# **Polkadot Dapp Alliance** 

# Abstract

The Polkadot Dapp Alliance is a collective of decentralized application (dapp) developers, projects and enthusiasts building on the Polkadot network. The alliance aims to accelerate the growth and adoption of dapps on Polkadot through strategic initiatives like marketing, education, events, documentation, tooling, and grants. This document will serve as a central resource to manage the alliance members, initiatives, communications, and track progress.

# Problem Statement

While Polkadot offers significant advantages for building dapps like scalability and cross-chain interoperability, dapp adoption on Polkadot is still nascent. Developers face challenges with inadequate documentation, tools, and ecosystem support. There is also a lack of awareness among end-users of the dapp solutions being built. The Polkadot Dapp Alliance seeks to address these issues by uniting key stakeholders to bootstrap the ecosystem. A system is needed to effectively manage members, surface collective needs, coordinate efforts, and measure impact.

# Manifesto

**Our Mission**

United by a vision of an open and decentralized future, we have come together as builders, educators, and leaders. Our mission is to cultivate a vibrant community that unlocks the full potential of decentralized applications on Polkadot - crafted by the people, for the people.

**Our Vision**

We envision a future where Polkadot dapps are the driving force behind meaningful innovations that enrich lives, strengthen societies, and propel humanity forward. A future built by a diverse community, united in purpose.

**Strength Through Unity**

Alone we are but whispers in the wind, but together we are a mighty roar. We believe in the power of unity without conformity. In mutual support, open collaboration, and shared knowledge, we can go further together.

**Openness and Decentralization**

Like Polkadot itself, we champion permissionless creation, transparent governance, and barrier-free innovation. No single entity will control the fate of all - instead, progress will be driven by the collective.

**Diversity and Inclusion**

We welcome and embrace diversity in all its forms - backgrounds, perspectives, abilities - as the seeds of our resilience, collective wisdom, and shared growth. Each of us has something vital to contribute.

**Knowledge for All**

Knowledge spreads light. We are committed to illuminating and empowering our community with the tools and insights they need to thrive. Education multiplies our potential.

**Conscious Growth**

As we build the future, we hold fast to our ethical compass. We will measure our success not just by what we achieve, but how - with integrity, sustainability, and justice.

**Eyes on the Horizon**

We are in this for the long haul. Our dreams will not be realized overnight, but step by step we will get there - together. Our vision is fixed on the horizon.
