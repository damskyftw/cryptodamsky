# Polkadot Dapp Alliance

## Abstract

The Polkadot Dapp Alliance is a collective of decentralized application (dapp) developers, projects and enthusiasts building on the Polkadot network. The alliance aims to accelerate the growth and adoption of dapps on Polkadot through strategic initiatives like marketing, education, events, documentation, tooling and grants.

This document will serve as a central resource to manage the alliance members, initiatives, communications and track progress.

## Problem Statement
