As with any blockchain, building decentralized applications (dApps) is a significant part of how a
developer can build on Polkadot.

As an application developer, you can compose your front-end apps in a few different ways. Because
the relay chain and its parachains are all built using the Polkadot SDK. You can often use the same
SDK to communicate with the relay chain, a parachain, or any other Substrate-based chain.

:::note Substrate-based chains use an SS58 encoding for their address formats.

Please see the [SS58 registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/) to see which
[chain corresponds to a given prefix](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/blob/main/ss58-registry.json),
and which prefixes are available.

## SDKS & Libraries

If one aims to develop a **dApp** (Decentralized App), the Polkadot ecosystem contains various SDKs
to tap into the relay chain and parachains. There are several languages already supported -
[see the tooling page for a detailed overview of different SDKs and libraries that are available.](./build-tools-index.md)

## Frameworks & Toolkits

For front-end applications, several options exist for interfacing with Substrate-based chains
(parachains, relay chains, etc.) and smart contracts. These will often interact with the RPC of a
Substrate node:

## Oracle Options

In the blockchain context, an _oracle_ is a way to bring real-world data onto the blockchain so that
it can be used by a decentralized application.

Oracles serve many purposes for application builder, as they allow for outside data (price feeds,
the ability to make HTTP requests, etc) to enter the decentralized world.

Oracle solutions range from centralized and trusted to decentralized and game-theory based. On the
centralized end of the spectrum, an oracle could be a single account that has the authority to
dictate the real-world data on-chain. On the decentralized end, a
[complex game of "chicken"](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/)
can be played among various staked actors who risk getting [slashed](../learn/learn-offenses.md) if
they don't submit the same data as everyone else.

When using an oracle in your application you should be aware of the benefits and risks that are
baked into its specific model.

## Decentralized Storage Options

Storage is an integral part of modern computer systems, and the same is true for distributed and
decentralized systems like a blockchain. When interacting with the Polkadot ecosystem, it will be
helpful if you familiarize yourself with the current Web3 approach towards decentralized storage.

## DCS (Decentralized Cloud Storage)

The key attribute that characterizes centralized cloud storage is the location of data. In
decentralized cloud storage, the key attribute becomes the data itself instead of the data's
location. This can be viewed as the shift from the centralized _location-centric_ storage approach
to the decentralized _content-centric_ approach.

slug: ../build-data
---

The tools that accentuate and aggregate the data within blockchains are integral for a multi-chain
future. Parachains will need robust and secure ways to index and aggregate data, such as a data
aggregation layer.

## Custom Indexer

### Subsquid

[Subsquid](https://subsquid.io/) is an open-source framework for building tailored GraphQL APIs to
query Substrate chain state and history.

Subsquid replaces direct gRPC node access with performant Squid archive gateways, allowing quick
synchronization of the API with the historical on-chain data.

Subsquid-powered APIs support filtering, pagination, union types, interfaces, and full-text search
out-of-the-box, and can be further extended with custom GraphQL resolvers.

### SubQuery

[SubQuery](https://subquery.network/) is a fast, flexible, and reliable open-source data indexer
that provides you with custom APIs for your Substrate/Polkadot project. We build the best,
fully-featured indexer, so you don‚Äôt have to, with:

- automatic support for any Substrate network
- support for all Polkadot smart contract frameworks (FrontierEVM, Acala EVM+, and Wasm)
- automated historical state tracking to enable faster partial re-indexing
- a lightweight and portable design that doesn't require centralized archives
- full support for GraphQL filtering, pagination, interfaces, subscriptions, and aggregations
- a future decentralized network acts as chain-agnostic data aggregation, indexing, and querying
  layer between blockchains and applications that will not require centralized services.

To start building, head to the [SubQuery documentation](https://academy.subquery.network/) where
you'll find quick start guides and walkthrough developer tutorials.

### The Graph

[The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) is a layer-1 indexing tool and querying layer for the
decentralized web, who announced an integration plan to bring
[indexing and querying to Polkadot](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/the-graph-bringing-indexing-and-querying-to-polkadot-6b433e381fe8).

The Graph allows developers to build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs. Applications can query
subgraphs using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).

## Analytics platform

### DIN

[DIN](https://din.lol/)(formally named Web3Go) is a Polkadot-based open data analytics platform that
provides infrastructure and tooling to help users visualize, curate, share, and analyze on-chain
data.

### Covalent

[Covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) offers a unified API to understand the data on a blockchain,
and is currently live on the [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) network, bringing visibility to
billions of blockchain data points to Polkadot via their unified API. The approach to deploying on
Moonbeam simplifies the development of Polkadot-based blockchain applications as compared to
implementing a full parachain or an on-demand parachain.

Covalent captures the entire history of blockchains and offers a way to zoom into data points
recorded in smart contracts that are often not accessible.

## Data warehouse

### BigQuery by Google Cloud

[BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) makes Polkadot blockchain data available for Google
Cloud users. Check this
[announcement](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/data-for-11-more-blockchains-in-bigquery-public-datasets)
for details on how to access the data.

## Block Explorers

As you can imagine, blockchain explorers also offer data analytics through an interface where users
can examine common data points.

Some block explorers in the Polkadot ecosystem are listed on the
[tools page](build-tools-index.md##block-explorers).

Polkadot is a blockchain network protocol that provides **shared security** among all connected
parachains and allowing all connected tasks to **interoperate** by using
[XCM](../learn/learn-xcm.md).

With the [Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk) and

Before diving into the various paths one can take in developing on Polkadot, it's essential to
realize and know key terms that make up the following sections. Even before considering what kind of
application you want to build, it's prudent to understand what Polkadot _is_, and what each
developmental component can do for you within the Polkadot ecosystem.

Before diving into any one of these tracks, it is encouraged to read about Polkadot and its networks
in order to gain context about the application you could make.

[Take a look at the various development network options here.](./build-network-overview.md)

## Building Parachains

Polkadot is canonically referred to as the relay chain. It is also considered a _layer zero_
protocol, as it enables the interoperability and shared security of multiple
[parachains](../learn/learn-parachains.md), which are _layer one_ protocols. Parachains currently
connect to a relay chain using the [Parachains Protocol](../learn/learn-parachains-protocol.md).
More elaborate (or simpler) tasks could be constructed in the future.

![build 1](../assets/build-1.png)

:::info

Throughout this document, you may encounter the term **runtime** or **STF (State Transition
Function)**. Both refer to the same concept, as they define how a particular system, i.e., a
blockchain, should deal with state changes externally and internally. Both of these terms are used
extensively in Polkadot and Substrate.

:::

Parachains built through the Polkadot SDK, open possibilities to construct complex **runtime**, or
**STF** (state transition function) the logic that would be too expensive to execute with smart
contracts. However, unlike smart contracts, parachains lack a mandatory gas metering system entirely
and could potentially be vulnerable to bugs that cause infinite loops (something that is prevented
by design in smart contracts). This vulnerability is mitigated by the
[weight system](https://docs.substrate.io/build/tx-weights-fees/) that is implemented in Substrate
-- although it places more of a burden on the developer of the parachain to perform properly
benchmarks.

:::info What is an on-demand parachain?

On-demand parachains use a "pay-as-you-go" model enabled by Agile Coretime to interact with the
relay chain. On-demand parachains will only produce a block when needed, unlike full parachains,
which have access to bulk coretime to produce a block at every block of the relay chain. When
building an on-demand parachain, you will use the same tools (like PDKs) and get all the benefits of
building a parachain without the cost drawback of purchasing bulk coretime.

:::

### Polkadot SDK Overview

Polkadot is built using the Polkadot SDK, which,
[the Polkadot node/host implementation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/polkadot/index.html),
within contains the source code for:

- **Substrate** - a set of core libraries used for constructing blockchains - mostly un-opinionated
- **FRAME** - the framework used to build Substrate runtimes - more opinionated
- **Cumulus** - parachain/task specific functions which allow for solo chains to become compatible
  with Polkadot

[Substrate](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/substrate/index.html)
is a highly configurable and dynamic framework for building blockchains. At a lower level, Substrate
provides a set of tools and libraries ranging from block production, finality gadgets to
peer-to-peer networking. Both Polkadot and Kusama, as well as most parachains, are built using
Substrate.

In essence, Substrate can break down a blockchain's development process by providing crucial
building blocks of functionality, removing the need for re-engineering complex mechanisms that
usually involved when developing a blockchain.

Substrate can be used as a basis for a parachain to connect to a relay chain like Polkadot or
Kusama, or even as a basis to form a conventional layer one solo chain.

Currently, the most streamlined way of utilizing Substrate is through
[FRAME](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html),
which conveniently allows for a runtime/STF to be generated from a set of modules (called
[pallets](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html#pallets)).
Runtimes in Substrate are built using [WebAssembly](../learn/learn-wasm.md) (Wasm), and represent
the state transition function for a network. FRAME provides a framework for
[pallets](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html#pallets),
to construct a runtime/STF and define how your task is supposed to behave. Ranging from
[identity](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_identity/index.html) to
[smart contracts](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_contracts/index.html),
pallets can be quite extensive in providing on-chain functionality.

Even though FRAME is heavily used, it is not the only way to create a valid runtime/STF using
Substrate. Substrate can be used to create new paradigms and abstractions. One such example is the
[Open Runtime Module Library (ORML)](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library),
which is another way of creating and using runtime modules.

:::note

Although most parachains utilize FRAME and Substrate to build runtime/STFs for connecting to the
relay chain, it is not contingent. Building a parachain using other tools is possible if they follow
the [Parachains Protocol](../learn/learn-parachains-protocol.md).

As a general rule of thumb, Substrate provides the means for this to become possible through
comparably minimal effort.

:::

#### Building Parachains with Cumulus

[Cumulus](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/cumulus/index.html)
is a set of tools that allows you to convert a blockchain developed using Substrate and FRAME into a
Polkadot-compatible Parachain. More specifically, it provides libraries for all of the necessary
parts of the Polkadot protocol necessary for Parachains to work, for example:

- Creating new parachain blocks via Collators
- Listening to the relay chain for updates
- Synchronizing upgrades between the parachain and relay chain

For most developers, the best place to start is to get familiar with Substrate independently,
followed by FRAME, with Cumulus as the final step to understanding the entire parachain building
process. This way, one can view how various paradigms are applied and decide on integrating or
utilizing Substrate for their particular use case.

Please see [our guides on getting started with coretime](build-guides-coretime-start.md) for how to
get started on building and deploying a parachain.

#### Parachains Benefits

Parachains contain their own runtime/STF logic and benefit from the shared security and the
cross-consensus messaging provided by the relay chain. Parachains permit high flexibility and
customization but require more effort to create and maintain over time. A production-grade parachain
is typically more involved to create due to the complexity involved in blockchain networks'
technical and economic aspects.

Parachains grant the creators more space to build the monetary system and other chain aspects from
the ground up. They will allow for a more concise and efficient execution of complex logic than a
smart contract platform could offer. Parachains also provide more flexibility in the form of
governance and can perform complete upgrades in a less controversial way than the current process of
hard forks.

Some examples of features you can have on a parachain:

- Custom fee structure (for example, pay a flat transaction fee or pay per byte).
- Shared security and finalization via the relay chain (Polkadot or Kusama).
- Custom monetary policy for the native token and local economy.
- Treasury to be funded through transitions in your state function.
- A governance mechanism that could manage a DAO that is responsible for allocating your on-chain
  treasury.

### Building a Pallet

While parachains are highly customizable, they are often complex to develop. If you wish to get
familiar with FRAME and Substrate, a good place to start is by building a pallet in a development
environment. A pallet is a fully customizable module that allows you to implement layer one logic
with relatively minimal development time on a fundamental level while still allowing the possibility
of building advanced functionality into your custom chain.

## Developing Smart Contracts

Smart contracts are another option that enables an often simpler developer experience. Below is a
quick comparison of how building a smart contract compares to building a parachain:

|                         | Parachains | Smart Contracts |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------- |
| Speed of Development    | -          | +               |
| Ease of Deployment      | -          | +               |
| Complexity of logic     | +          | -               |
| Maintenance overhead    | -          | +               |
| Level of customization  | +          | -               |
| Strict resource control | -          | +               |
| Native chain features   | +          | -               |
| Scalability             | +          | -               |

:::info What's the difference between a smart contract and a pallet?

If you recall, a parachain comprises a runtime/STF usually built on Substrate. These runtime/STFs
often utilize FRAME, which is subsequently made of pallets. Pallets are part of a Substrate
runtime/STF, whereas smart contracts are a product of a pallet (see:
[pallet_contracts](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_contracts/index.html)).
Pallets require more engineering and thought, as they can directly affect the chain's state.

For a more comprehensive (and maintained) comparison, be sure to check out the
[comparison from the Polkadot SDK documentation](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/runtime_vs_smart_contract/index.html).

### ink! and EVM-based Smart Contracts

At a high level, a _smart contract_ is simply some code that exists at an address on a chain and is
callable by external actors. Whether it's [EVM-based](https://polkadot-evm.github.io/frontier/) or
written using [ink!](https://use.ink/), smart contracts are sandboxed, executable programs that live
on-chain.

:::note

_The Polkadot relay chain does not support smart contracts._ However, several parachains do. See the
[smart contracts guide](build-smart-contracts.md#parachains) for the exact chains in which you can
deploy contracts on Polkadot.

:::

A Polkadot-native choice for smart contracts is [ink!](https://use.ink/). Other parachains that
offer EVM-based contracts written in Solidity alongside ink!
[are also available](./build-smart-contracts#parachains).

Because smart contracts exist on a single chain at a time, they can have smooth interoperability
with other smart contracts on the same chain. However, they will always be constrained and limited
by the inherent characteristics of their host chain.

As a developer, you will need to consider the storage and complexity of your smart contract to
ensure that gas usage stays within reasonable bounds. Consider using the listed options on the
[decentralized storage](build-storage.md) page to keep the data and submit only the content address
on the chain.

:::info Building a smart contract

Please see the [smart contracts guide](build-smart-contracts.md) for how to get started on building
a smart contract.

## Developing a dApp

If one aims to develop a **dApp** (Decentralized App), the Polkadot ecosystem contains various SDKs
to tap into the relay chain and parachains.

For front-end applications, several options exist for interfacing with Substrate-based chains
(parachains, relay chains, etc.) and smart contracts. These often will interact with the RPC of a
Substrate node.

[Please visit the documentation for developing dApps and other general client-side development resources.](build-dapp)

For a complete list of tools, please take a look here:

## Using the Polkadot SDK

The Polkadot SDK is comprised of **three** important repositories:

- [**Polkadot**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/index.html#polkadot) -
  This included both client implementation and runtime until the runtime was moved to the Polkadot
  Fellows organization.
- [**Substrate**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/index.html#substrate) -
  The underlying core primitives and libraries for building blockchains (any blockchain, not just
  one for Polkadot). Much of Polkadot is built with Substrate.
- [**Cumulus**](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/index.html#cumulus) -
  A set of libraries and tools pertaining specifically to connecting blockchains to Polkadot, known
  as parachains.

> For an in-depth dive into the monorepo, it is highly recommended that you look into the
> [Polkadot SDK Docs, which explains everything.](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/index.html)

:::info What is a task?

You might see the term "task" referenced often in place of "parachain". In most cases, it refers to
a process utilizing the relay chain's compute. This could be a parachain or any other computational
process, provided that it adheres to the Polkadot protocol interface.

The full definition can be found [here](../learn/learn-agile-coretime.md#task).

:::

1. **Reserving** a [`ParaId`](../general/glossary.md#paraid), where you will upload your runtime and
   genesis state.
2. **Compiling** the runtime (written in Rust) to a [WebAssembly](../learn/learn-wasm.md) blob,
   thereby defining how your state transitions from one state to the next. This runtime is created
   using the Polkadot SDK.
3. **Ensure** your chain spec is viable and ready to be deployed as a live, working parachain.
4. **Generating** your genesis state and wasm.
5. **Obtaining** a core, most likely through a
   [Coretime marketplace](../learn/learn-guides-coretime-marketplaces.md).
6. **Assigning** that core to your[ `ParaId`](../general/glossary.md#paraid).
7. **Ensuring** you have at least one honest, synced collator for your task

## Deploying on a Core

Once you have your runtime and pallets developed, you will be able to deploy it on a
[core](../learn/learn-agile-coretime.md#core), which is how one utilizes the shared security of the
Polkadot network. One does so by:

keywords: [coretime, blockspace, parathread, parachain, cores, coretime, agile]
slug: ../build-guides-coretime-troubleshoot
---

This page aims to cover and aggregate various resources that relate to troubleshooting common
problems when using the Polkadot SDK or deploying on a core.

## FAQ / Troubleshooting

### Why do I have to sync Paseo locally? Can't I just use a remote, trusted node and connect to that?

You can remotely connect to Paseo network via the `--relay-chain-rpc-urls` flag, which can be passed
to your node. Unfortunately, the caveat is you can't use this node for collation at this time -
meaning if you intend on being a collator/validator for your blockchain and intend to create blocks,
you need to sync the chain locally.

### My collator is not producing blocks

Check these sanity checklists:

- https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/178/how-can-i-get-my-parachain-to-produce-blocks-sanity-checklist
- https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/1394/our-parachain-doesnt-produce-blocks-checklist

### I want to run more than one collator, how do I do that?

Ideally, you would want to run these on separate machines/servers, but you could as long as you
ensure you can provide different RPC/WebSocket and P2P ports for each collator. You also may need to
sync a separate instance of Paseo for each collator on the same machine. You also will need to
choose the block production mechanism like
[Aura](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/5572/production-like-parachain-setup-and-launch).

### Why do we only have one collator in the parachain guides on the Wiki? Isn't it better to have more?

Mostly for simplicity. If we have more than one collator, we would have to also spin it up, which
would be a hassle on a single machine (it is possible though). Of course, if you had an actual
network with multiple collators, it is assumed you'd have separate VPS/servers for each.

### Why are we registering parathreads and not parachains?

When registering a parachain on a relay chain, they are assigned a `ParaID`, and they are referred
to as Parathreads till they start producing blocks. _Parathreads_ are a bit of an outdated term now.
They refer to what are now known as on-demand parachains. Although they be references in various
places through PolkadotJS, docs, or other UIs, really we only have two types of parachain: on-demand
parachains, and parachains which use bulk coretime.

## macOS

You can install Rust and set up a Substrate development environment on Apple macOS computers with
either Intel or an Apple M1 processors.

### Before you begin

Before you install Rust and set up your development environment on macOS, verify that your computer
meets the following basic requirements:

- Operating system version is 10.7 Lion, or later.
- Processor speed of at least 2Ghz, 3Ghz recommended.
- Memory of at least 8 GB RAM, 16 GB recommended.
- Storage of at 10 GB available space.
- Broadband Internet connection.

#### Support for Apple Silicon

Protobuf must be installed before the build process can begin. To install it, run the following
command:

`brew install protobuf`

#### Install Homebrew

In most cases, you should use Homebrew to install and manage packages on macOS computers. If you
don't already have Homebrew installed on your local computer, you should download and install it
before continuing.

To install Homebrew:

1. Open the Terminal application.

2. Download and install Homebrew by running the following command:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
   ```

3. Verify Homebrew has been successfully installed by running the following command:

   ```bash
   brew --version
   ```

   The command displays output similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Homebrew 3.3.1
   Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision c6c488fbc0f; last commit 2021-10-30)
   Homebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision 66bab33b26; last commit 2021-10-30)
   ```

### Installation

Because the blockchain requires standard cryptography to support the generation of public/private
key pairs and the validation of transaction signatures, you must also have a package that provides
cryptography, such as `openssl`.

To install `openssl` and the Rust toolchain on macOS:

1. Open the Terminal application.

2. Ensure you have an updated version of Homebrew by running the following command:

   ```bash
   brew update
   ```

3. Install the `openssl` package by running the following command:

   ```bash
   brew install openssl
   ```

4. Download the `rustup` installation program and use it to install Rust by running the following
   command:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

5. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation.

6. Update your current shell to include Cargo by running the following command:

   ```bash
   source ~/.cargo/env
   ```

7. Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version by running the following
   commands:

   ```bash
   rustup default stable
   rustup update
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

8. Add the `nightly` release and the `nightly` WebAssembly (wasm) targets to your development
   environment by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   rustup update nightly
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
   ```

9. [Verify your installation here.](#verifying-installation)

10. Install `cmake` using the following command:

```
brew install cmake
```

## Linux

Rust supports most Linux distributions. Depending on the specific distribution and version of the
operating system you use, you might need to add some software dependencies to your environment. In
general, your development environment should include a linker or C-compatible compiler such as
`clang` and an appropriate integrated development environment (IDE).

### Before you begin

Check the documentation for your operating system for information about the packages that are
installed and how to download and install any additional packages you might need. For example, if
you use Ubuntu, you can use the Ubuntu Advanced Packaging Tool (`apt`) to install the
`build-essential` package:

```bash
sudo apt install build-essential
```

At a minimum, you need the following packages before you install Rust:

```text
clang curl git make
```

Because the blockchain requires standard cryptography to support the generation of public/private
key pairs and the validation of transaction signatures, you must also have a package that provides
cryptography, such as `libssl-dev` or `openssl-devel`.

### Install required packages and Rust

To install the Rust toolchain on Linux:

1. Log on to your computer and open a terminal shell.

2. Check the packages you have installed on the local computer by running an appropriate package
   management command for your Linux distribution.

3. Add any package dependencies you are missing to your local development environment by running an
   appropriate package management command for your Linux distribution.

   For example, on Ubuntu Desktop or Ubuntu Server, you might run a command similar to the
   following:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev protobuf-compiler
   ```

   Click the tab titles to see examples for other Linux operating systems:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
<Tabs groupId="clients" values={[ { label: 'Debian', value: 'deb'}, { label: 'Arch', value: 'arch'}, { label: 'Fedora', value: 'fed'}, { label: 'openSUSE', value: 'opensuse'} ]}>

<TabItem value="deb">

```sh
sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="arch">

```sh
pacman -Syu --needed --noconfirm curl git clang make protobuf
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="fed">

```sh
sudo dnf update
sudo dnf install clang curl git openssl-devel make protobuf-compiler
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="opensuse">

```sh
sudo zypper install clang curl git openssl-devel llvm-devel libudev-devel make protobuf
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Remember that different distributions might use different package managers and bundle packages in
different ways. For example, depending on your installation selections, Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu
Server might have different packages and different requirements. However, the packages listed in the
command-line examples are applicable for many common Linux distributions, including Debian, Linux
Mint, MX Linux, and Elementary OS.

1. Download the `rustup` installation program and use it to install Rust by running the following
   command:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

2. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation.

3. Update your current shell to include Cargo by running the following command:

   ```bash
   source $HOME/.cargo/env
   ```

4. Verify your installation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```

5. Configure the Rust toolchain to default to the latest stable version by running the following
   commands:

   ```bash
   rustup default stable
   rustup update
   ```

6. Add the `nightly` release and the `nightly` WebAssembly (wasm) targets to your development
   environment by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   rustup update nightly
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
   ```

## Windows (WSL)

In general, UNIX-based operating systems‚Äîlike macOS or Linux‚Äîprovide a better development
environment for building Substrate-based blockchains.

However, if your local computer uses Microsoft Windows instead of a UNIX-based operating system, you
can configure it with additional software to make it a suitable development environment for building
Substrate-based blockchains. To prepare a development environment on a computer running Microsoft
Windows, you can use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to emulate a UNIX operating environment.

### Before you begin

Before installing on Microsoft Windows, verify the following basic requirements:

- You have a computer running a supported version of the Microsoft Windows operating system.
- You must be running Microsoft Windows 10, version 2004 or later, or Microsoft Windows 11 to
  install Windows Subsystem for Linux on a computer with the Windows desktop operating system.
- You must be running Microsoft Windows Server 2019, or later, to install Windows Subsystem for
  Linux on a computer with the Windows server operating system.
- You have good internet connection and access to a shell terminal on your local computer.

### Set up Windows Subsystem for Linux

Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) enables you to emulate a Linux environment on a computer that uses
the Windows operating system. The primary advantage of this approach for Substrate development is
that you can use all of the code and command-line examples as described in the Substrate
documentation. For example, you can run common commands‚Äîsuch as `ls` and `ps`‚Äîunmodified. By using
Windows Subsystem for Linux, you can avoid configuring a virtual machine image or a dual-boot
operating system.

To prepare a development environment using Windows Subsystem for Linux:

1. Check your Windows version and build number to see if Windows Subsystem for Linux is enabled by
   default.

   If you have Microsoft Windows 10, version 2004 (Build 19041 and higher), or Microsoft Windows 11,
   Windows Subsystem for Linux is available by default and you can continue to the next step.

   If you have an older version of Microsoft Windows installed, see
   [WSL manual installation steps for older versions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual).
   If you are installing on an older version of Microsoft Windows, you can download and install WLS
   2 if your computer has Windows 10, version 1903 or higher.

2. Select Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt from the Start menu, right-click, then **Run as
   administrator**.

3. In the PowerShell or Command Prompt terminal, run the following command:

   ```bash
   wsl --install
   ```

   This command enables the required WSL 2 components that are part of the Windows operating system,
   downloads the latest Linux kernel, and installs the Ubuntu Linux distribution by default.

   If you want to review the other Linux distributions available, run the following command:

   ```bash
   wsl --list --online
   ```

4. After the distribution is downloaded, close the terminal.

5. Click the Start menu, select **Shut down or sign out**, then click **Restart** to restart the
   computer.

   Restarting the computer is required to start the installation of the Linux distribution. It can
   take a few minutes for the installation to complete after you restart.

   For more information about setting up WSL as a development environment, see
   [Set up a WSL development environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment).

### Install required packages and Rust

To install the Rust toolchain on WSL:

1. Click the Start menu, then select **Ubuntu**.

2. Type a UNIX user name to create user account.

3. Type a password for your UNIX user, then retype the password to confirm it.

4. Download the latest updates for the Ubuntu distribution using the Ubuntu Advanced Packaging Tool
   (`apt`) by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```

5. Add the required packages for the Ubuntu distribution by running the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install --assume-yes git clang curl libssl-dev llvm libudev-dev make protobuf-compiler
   ```

6. Download the `rustup` installation program and use it to install Rust for the Ubuntu distribution
   by running the following command:

   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```

7. Follow the prompts displayed to proceed with a default installation.

8. Update your current shell to include Cargo by running the following command:

   ```bash
   source ~/.cargo/env
   ```

9. Verify your installation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   rustc --version
   ```

10. Configure the Rust toolchain to use the latest stable version as the default toolchain by
    running the following commands:

    ```bash
    rustup default stable
    rustup update
    ```

11. Add the `nightly` version of the toolchain and the `nightly` WebAssembly (`wasm`) target to your
    development environment by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    rustup update nightly
    rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly
    ```

12. [Verify your installation here.](#verifying-installation)

## Verifying Installation

Verify the configuration of your development environment by running the following command:

```bash
rustup show
rustup +nightly show
```

The command displays output similar to the following:

```bash
# rustup show

active toolchain
----------------

stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (default)
rustc 1.61.0 (fe5b13d68 2022-05-18)

# rustup +nightly show

active toolchain
----------------

nightly-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu (overridden by +toolchain on the command line)
rustc 1.63.0-nightly (e7144
```

## Install `polkadot-parachain` and `chain-spec-builder`

The `polkadot-parachain` can be used a universal collator instance for running most of the
parachains (an
["omninode beta"](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-parachain-omni-node-gathering-ideas-and-feedback/7823)).
It can be installed as follows:

```sh
cargo install --git https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk --tag polkadot-v1.15.1 --force polkadot-parachain-bin
```

`chain-spec-builder` is how you will generate chain specifications for your network. It requires a
`wasm` runtime bundle to generate the chain specification from.

It can be installed as follows:

> Note that chain-spec-builder only works with select Polkadot SDK versions (`<v1.13.0`)

```sh
cargo install staging-chain-spec-builder
```

:::warning Not a production ready guide.

This guide is considered a moving document and currently uses the **Paseo** testnet. This guide is
also applicable to the parachains on the Kusama relay chain, as coretime is also enabled there.

**This instructions on this guide are applicable for the Polkadot SDK repository with tag
`polkadot-v1.15.1`**

:::

This guide aims to get you up and running with the basics of:

- **Compiling** and configuring your first template
- **Obtaining** Coretime (bulk or on-demand)
- **Deploying** your template on your procured core

## Getting ROC and Reserving a ParaId

Before starting to work with coretime, you'll need some ROC tokens to pay fees, reserve a
[ParaId](../general/glossary.md#paraid), and more.

Head over to Polkadot-JS to reserve a [ParaId](../general/glossary.md#paraid). We'll need a ParaId
to upload our parachain's code:

1. Get the [Polkadot-JS Web Extension.](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/)
2. Create a wallet, and get some [ROC via the faucet.](https://faucet.polkadot.io/) with your new
   address.
3. Go to the [Polkadot-JS Web App](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#), and make sure you select
   **Paseo** as your network via the tabs on the side
   [or visit this link to get to Paseo directly](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpaseo.dotters.network#/explorer)
4. Head to
   [Network > Parachains > Parathreads (the tab)](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/parathreads)
5. [Follow these instructions to reserve a ParaId.](../learn/learn-guides-coretime-parachains.md#reserve-paraid)

Visit the [Accounts](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/accounts) tab to view all registered accounts
and associated balances within the Polkadot-JS Extension. Once finished, you should see your new
ParaId at the bottom of the list within
[Network > Parachains > Parathreads](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/parathreads) with the
option to "Deregister" to the right:

![Registered ParaID in PolkadotJs](../assets/coretime/Coretime-ParaId-Registered.png)

## Compiling Parachain Runtime and Generating Wasm Blob

We can now move on to working with the template. Essential prerequisites are:

1. **Have** a command line, git, and other common development tools to edit code/files.
2. **Rust**, its associated tooling, the nightly toolchain, and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown`
   compilation target.

:::info Install dependencies

Visit [the dependencies' installation](./build-guides-install-deps.md) page before starting.

:::

This guide uses release
[`polkadot-v1.15.1`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/releases/tag/polkadot-v1.15.1), for
associated tooling (such as `polkadot-parachain` and `chain-spec-builder`).

We will be using the
[Polkadot SDK's parachain template](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template),
which is mirrored in the templates folder within Polkadot SDK repository.

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:paritytech/polkadot-sdk-parachain-template.git
```

Now, navigate to `polkadot-sdk-parachain-template/`:

```bash
cd polkadot-sdk-parachain-template
```

Open this in your code editor of choice. This template contains the necessary dependencies we need
to utilize a core.

### Compiling the Parachain Template Node

This tutorial won't go into the specifics of the template, nor will it go into the specifics of
FRAME and Substrate. All you need to know is the following:

- `runtime/` - Contains the runtime and business logic. This is how all of your pallets (runtime
  modules) are configured. The runtime, once it's compiled as a WebAssembly blob, is uploaded
  on-chain.
- `node/` - The node implementation, which takes care of networking and RPC setup.

> Pallets are essentially just Rust crates, which are imported as dependencies, as seen in
> `runtime/Cargo.toml`. Read more about
> [pallets here.](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/polkadot_sdk/frame_runtime/index.html#pallets)

When we compile our template, we can extract the runtime code as a WebAssembly `.wasm` blob, which
is one of the key artifacts for registering our parachain on the relay chain.

Build the node using the following command:

```shell
cargo build --release
```

For the sake of this example, we won't go into adding or modifying any pallets. However, this is
definitely a next step after you get used to deploying your parachain.

### Customizing our chain specification's patch file

The chain specification is a JSON file that describes Polkadot SDK-based networks. It usually
contains the genesis runtime (in hex) under `genesis.runtimeGenesis.code` and also contains genesis
values/state for the pallets included in your runtime.

You can bootstrap your network with some initial values, such as initial collators, balances for
certain accounts, and more. This is done using a patch file, which the `chain-spec-builder` tool
uses to create the full chain specification of your network. You should do the following to create
your `patch.json`:

Feel free to use the patch provided here, which you can look to tweak to your liking.

1. Create the file: `touch patch.json`
2. Paste the below patch JSON.

The patch JSON states that:

- The `Alice` and `Bob` accounts get a substantial balance.
- `Alice` is the collator and block producer of this network. This makes it easy for us to run our
  collator with `--alice` later on.
- `Alice` is the sudo key of our network.

:::info Make sure you replace `YOUR_PARA_ID_HERE` with your reserved ParaId!

This should be the same as the ID you reserved.

:::

```json
{
  "balances": {
    "balances": [
      ["5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY", 1152921504606846976],

  },
  "parachainInfo": {

        {

  },
  "sudo": {
    "key": "5GrwvaEF5zXb26Fz9rcQpDWS57CtERHpNehXCPcNoHGKutQY"
  }
}
```

### Generating the chain specification

> Ensure you have
> the[ `chain-spec-builder`](./build-guides-install-deps.md#install-polkadot-parachain-and-chain-spec-builder)
> installed before following along!

By now, you should have `patch.json` created and populated, and your `./target` folder should look
something akin to:

```sh
./target/release/wbuild/parachain-template-runtime
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.lock
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Cargo.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parachain_template_runtime.compact.compressed.wasm
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parachain_template_runtime.compact.wasm
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ parachain_template_runtime.wasm
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ target
```

We'll be using `parachain_template_runtime.wasm` in conjunction with `chain-spec-builder` to build
our chain specification:

```sh
chain-spec-builder create \
-v \
-r ./target/release/wbuild/parachain-template-runtime/parachain_template_runtime.wasm \
patch patch.json
```

You should now see `chain_spec.json` generated, with the message `Genesis config verification: OK`.
The `-v` does a superficial verification of the JSON to ensure all fields are properly populated.

Next, you'll need to modify a few things in your chain spec, namely by adding the following fields
to make it parachain-ready. Once again, make sure you set `para_id` to the one you reserved earlier:

```json
"protocolId": "my-live-protocol",
"properties": {
   "ss58Format": 42,
   "tokenDecimals": 12,
   "tokenSymbol": "UNIT"
},
"para_id": PARA_ID_HERE,
"relay_chain": "paseo",
```

Once you finish modifying the file, it should look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "Custom",
  "id": "custom",
  "chainType": "Live",
  "bootNodes": [],
  "telemetryEndpoints": null,
  "protocolId": "my-live-protocol",
  "properties": {
    "ss58Format": 42,
    "tokenDecimals": 12,
    "tokenSymbol": "UNIT"
  },
  "para_id": YOUR_PARA_ID_HERE,
  "relay_chain": "paseo",
  "codeSubstitutes": {},
  "genesis": { ... }
}
```

Feel free to customize various aspects of your spec, such as the `UNIT` ticker, `name`, `id`, or
other fields.

Now you should open your `chain_spec.json`, and use this checklist to ensure all the necessary
fields are in place:

1. **Make** sure that `relay_chain` is set to the target relay chain (`paseo`, in our case)
2. **Make** sure that `para_id` (right below `relay_chain`) is set to your reserved ParaId
3. **Make** sure that our `chain_type` is set to `Live`
4. **Optionally**, change the name, id, and token symbol of your chain.

If you fail to do one of these, your chain may fail to produce blocks.

For more information on chain specifications,
[check out the reference document from the Polkadot SDK.](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_sdk_docs/reference_docs/chain_spec_genesis/index.html)

### Generating the Runtime and Genesis

With our chain specification successfully generated, we can move to generating the genesis state and
runtime.

Generate the genesis following the instructions below:

```shell
polkadot-parachain export-genesis-head --chain chain_spec.json genesis
```

Although you can use the WebAssembly within `wbuild`, for ease of access you can also regenerate
your WebAssembly blob with the following:

```shell
polkadot-parachain export-genesis-wasm --chain chain_spec.json genesis-wasm
```

Within your project folder, you should now have two files:

- **`genesis`** - the initial state of your parachain.
- **`genesis-wasm`** - the initial runtime WebAssembly blob of your parachain.

## Running Your Collator

> Make sure you have the
> [`polkadot-parachain`](./build-guides-install-deps.md#installing-the-omninode) binary installed!

Before you are able to connect your collator, you must sync the relay chain. Depending on your
download speed, the time to sync may vary. In order to avoid storing the full state of the relay
chain, be sure to run with the appropriate pruning flags (`blocks-pruning` and `state-pruning`):

:::info Explaining `blocks-pruning` and `state-pruning`

A Polkadot SDK-based node has two pruning modes:

- `blocks-pruning` - Prunes block bodies (the list of extrinsics in the block) from a specified
  height (default: `256`)
- `state-pruning` - Prunes the overall state from a specified height

Both of these flags aid in reducing the amount of disk space taken up by the relay chain. Note that
`state-pruning` is only used for the first initial sync for the database.

:::

```shell
polkadot-parachain --collator \
--alice \
--chain chain_spec.json \
--force-authoring \
--base-path <your-base-path-here> \
-- \
--chain=paseo \
--sync warp \
--blocks-pruning 256 \
--state-pruning 256
```

> **Fun fact**: This command really spins up _two_ nodes: your collator node for your parachain,
> along with an embedded relay chain node, hence the separation in the command via `--`.

You should now see your relay chain syncing, reaching the same target that your target relay chain
is currently at:

```bash
2024-05-07 11:43:18 [Relaychain] ‚öôÔ∏è  Syncing 490.8 bps, target=#10342815 (9 peers), best: #10013784 (0x91d7‚Ä¶aeb2), finalized #10013704 (0x8556‚Ä¶e679), ‚¨á 8.3MiB/s ‚¨Ü 1.2kiB/s
```

## Register the Parachain as a Parathread

With your **`genesis`** and **`genesis-wasm`** created, you can now create your parathread. Head
back to
[Network > Parachains > Parathreads (the tab)](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/parachains/parathreads)
in PolkadotJS, and click _+ Parathread_ in the top right. Now, you can upload your runtime and
genesis accordingly:

1. Upload `genesis-wasm` in the `code` field
2. Upload `genesis` in the `initial state` field

![Upload chain artifacts](../assets/coretime/coretime-register-parathread.png)

Pay the deposit, and you're good to go! Keep in mind the parathread takes around **~2 hours** to
onboard. You can scroll down to your ParaId to see it onboarding, for example:

![Onboarding ParaId](../assets/coretime/coretime-parachain-onboarding.png)

## Procure Coretime

> ** Your node should be synced with the relay before this step.**

Procuring a core is easy with coretime marketplaces already available. Visit
[The Coretime Marketplaces](../learn/learn-guides-coretime-marketplaces.md) page to learn more about
them, and purchase a core!

We have two options:

1. [**Bulk**](../learn/learn-agile-coretime.md#bulk-coretime) - obtain a set amount of coretime in
   bulk.
2. [**On-demand**](../learn/learn-agile-coretime.md#on-demand-coretime) - pay as we go for our block
   production.

With bulk coretime, we assign a core to our ParaId, and as long as that core is valid, our parachain
will produce blocks and finalize them via the relay chain until we have to renew the core.

It's worth noting that you can easily experiment using on-demand extrinsics, then later switch to a
bulk coretime model. For now, let's start with on-demand coretime to get our first blocks going.

**It is recommended that you first try an on-demand assignment, then move to a bulk assignment after
you confirm your chain can create blocks!**

### On-Demand Coretime

Provided your collator is synced, you can create a block using an on-demand extrinsic.

1. Head to [PolkadotJS > Extrinsics](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/extrinsics)
2. Issue the `onDemandAssignmentProvider.placeOrderAllowDeath` extrinsic
3. Set the `max_amount` to at least `1000000000000` and `paraId` to your ParaId.
4. As long as your collator is running, you should see your block height increase from 0 to 1!

![On-demand coretime assignment](../assets/coretime/coretime-on-demand-assignment.png)

### Bulk Coretime: Assigning your Core

If everything is working as intended, you can now choose to assign bulk coretime to your parachain
for persistent block generation. For this assignment,
[RegionX's CoreHub](https://app.regionx.tech/regions?network=paseo) will be used to purchase and
assign cores.

:::info Getting Coretime ROC

In the upper right, you will see two balances: one for the relay chain, and one for the coretime
chain. Before you can purchase a core, you need ROC on the coretime chain. RegionX includes a tool
for doing so:

1. Head to General > Cross Chain Transfer on the right, and transfer 10 ROC:

![Region X cross chain transfer](../assets/coretime/regionx-cross-chain-roc.png)

2. Sign the transaction with Polkadot-JS. If all goes well, you should see the balance update in the
   upper right:

![Region X cross chain transfer](../assets/coretime/regionx-balance-change.png)

:::

1. Connect your wallet and make sure you select **Paseo** as your network:

![Connect your wallet to RegionX](../assets/coretime/coretime-regionx-connect-wallet.png)

2. Click **Purchase a Core** on the left:

![GMcdatDW8AEC8kh](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r12b0mxMC.jpg)

3. In the lower right, click "Purchase Core":

![Purchase a core](../assets/coretime/regionx-purchase-bulk.png)

4. Go to **My Regions**, and click to select your region, then click **Assign** on the right side:

![Select and assign region](../assets/coretime/regionx-select-region.png)

5. Click **Add Task**, and input your ParaId along with a name for your chain:

![Add a new task](../assets/coretime/regionx-add-task.png)

6. Select your task, and select **Provisional Assignment**, and sign using Polkadot JS:

![Assign the core](../assets/coretime/regionx-assign-region.png)

7. Once the transaction is confirmed, provided everything is synced, your collator is running, and
   the region has begun, you should see blocks being persistently created as they were with the
   on-demand extrinsic:

![GMcdatDW8AEC8kh](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r12b0mxMC.jpg)

## What's Next?

Now that you can launch a layer one blockchain, the possibilities are endless:

- Setup a local development environment for your parachain
- Create a pallet
- [Take a look at the OpenZepplin template - which has a lot more pallets configured.](build-guides-coretime-start.md#openzepplin-templates--guides)
- Upgrade your network

Web3 Foundation regularly supports developer focused events! Be the first to know by signing up for
the [Polkadot newsletter](https://polkadot.com/community/newsroom) and the
[Kusama newsletter](https://kusama.network/newsletter/).

## Host a Hackathon

As one of our objectives in the Web3 Foundation is promoting the
[Web3 technology stack](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-open-source), we would like to
support any individual or team who wants to organize a hackathon that gets more developers to
understand Polkadot and Substrate in your city or online.

We are not only providing technical resources for you, but we can have someone from our team give a
hands-on workshop/presentation about the technology to help participants get started hacking on it
more quickly.

### Why you should host a hackathon?

- Connect with the Web3 Foundation team and larger community
- Support Web 3.0 education, opportunities, and more
- Learn the bleeding-edge technology

## How do hackathons differ from workshops?

Hackathons (AKA Buildathons) are aimed at participants who want to deliver their prototype and
demonstrate their ideas to reality in a short period (few hours - one day), or online in a few
weeks. Workshops are more for getting developers familiar with the tooling and understanding more
about what are the resources currently available and how they can make use of it.

## How can you run a hackathon in your city?

Get in touch with the W3F team by [email](mailto:community@web3.foundation) or ask us via our
[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#w3f:matrix.org) chat.

id: build-hrmp-channels
title: Opening HRMP Channels
sidebar_label: Opening HRMP Channels
description: Steps on how to open HRMP channels between parachains.
keywords: [HRMP, parachain, statemint, proposal, asset hub, statemine]
slug: ../build-hrmp-channels
---

In order to communicate over [HRMP](../learn/learn-xcm-transport.md#hrmp-xcmp-lite), parachains must
establish channels by registering them on the relay chain. Like
[XCMP](../learn/learn-xcm-transport.md#xcmp-cross-chain-message-passing), HRMP is a message
transport protocol, but passes all messages via the relay chain. When XCMP is implemented on
Polkadot, HRMP is planned to be deprecated and phased out.

HRMP channels are uni-directional. Bi-directional communication between two parachains will require
two channels, one in each direction.

## Opening HRMP Channels

Opening a channel between two parachains is a two-phase process, with one chain first initiating a
channel request and then the second chain accepting it. When neither chain is a
[system chain](../learn/learn-system-chains.md), they will use the `hrmpInitOpenChannel` and
`hrmpAcceptOpenChannel` calls, respectively.

Each chain must dispatch the following calls on the relay chain from its parachain origin.

1. `hrmp > hrmpInitOpenChannel(recipient, proposedMaxCapacity, proposedMaxMessageSize)`: Initiates
   channel establishment by creating a channel request with a given configuration. Note that the max
   capacity and max message size must be within the `configuration`'s limits.

2. `hrmp > hrmpAcceptOpenChannel(sender)`: Accept the channel open request from the given sender.

In order to dispatch a call from its sovereign origin, a parachain may use governance to send the
encoded call in a `Transact` instruction to the relay chain, but it may also execute this logic
autonomously (e.g. on the notification that a channel was requested).

### Examples of HRMP Channel Management

There are several ways to trigger a specific message from a parachain's origin. The naive way is to
write the program off-chain and submit it using the XCM pallet's `send` extrinsic. Sending arbitrary
programs is gated by a privileged origin, so who can initiate that depends on each chain's
configuration. The chain may need to go through governance to dispatch the extrinsic.

Another option is to write the programs that a chain will send ahead of time and incorporate them
into the runtime. These programs could be behind extrinsics with their own privileged origins, or
even unprivileged origins. As the extrinsic can perform any checks prior to sending the message, the
runtime developer can program things like allowing any signed origin to dispatch a call accepting an
open HRMP channel request with another parachain.

Note that this is actually how other extrinsics (e.g. to teleport assets) in the XCM pallet work;
they construct XCM programs locally from a user's inputs and, assuming all checks pass, send the
program to the destination.

In addition, the logic could be autonomous and react to other instructions that the chain receives.
For example, see Polimec's
[implementation](https://github.com/Polimec/polimec-node/blob/da9d1ee0062ead7a62f815647813ada48e4c2250/pallets/xcm-executor/src/lib.rs#L890)
of the `XcmExecutor`, which handles notifications of channel requests and acceptance.

## Opening HRMP Channels with System Parachains

The
[`establish_channel_with_system`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/polkadot_runtime_parachains/hrmp/pallet/dispatchables/fn.establish_channel_with_system.html)
call can be used to establish a bi-directional channel between any parachain and a system chain.
This call needs to be dispatched from the parachain via an XCM program to execute on the Relay
Chain.

For instance, the call to be executed on the relay chain to establish a bi-directional channel
between a parachain and the Asset Hub with `ParaID` 1000 is `0x3c0ae8030000`

![asset-hub-hrmp-channel](../assets/asset-hub/establish-channel-asset-hub.png)

Here is an example call with an XCM program sent from the parachain to Paseo relay chain to
establish channel a bi-directional channel with Paseo Asset Hub -
`0x0f001f000301000314000400000000070010a5d4e81300000000070010a5d4e80006000300c16678419c183c0ae8030000140d01000001003145`

![asset-hub-hrmp-channel-xcm](../assets/asset-hub/asset-hub-establish-channel-xcm.png)

## Opening HRMP Channels Between Two System Parachains

As of Polkadot and Kusama runtimes 1,001,000, anyone can call an `establishSystemChannel` extrinsic
with two system parachains as arguments in order to establish a channel from the given sender to
receiver.

id: build-integrate-assets
title: Using AssetHub
sidebar_label: Using AssetHub
description: Tools that you can use for integrating assets.
keywords: [assets, integration, api, operations]
slug: ../build-integrate-assets
---

The relay chain does not natively support assets beyond its native token. This functionality exists
in parachains. On both Polkadot and Kusama, this parachain is called Asset Hub.

The Asset Hub provides a first-class interface for creating, managing, and using fungible and
non-fungible assets. The fungible interface is similar to Ethereum's ERC-20 standard. However, the
data structures and stateful operations are encoded directly into the chain's runtime, making
operations fast and fee-efficient.

Beyond merely supporting assets, integrating an Asset Hub into your systems has several benefits for
infrastructure providers and users:

- Support for on-chain assets.
- Significantly lower transaction fees (about 1/10) than the relay chain.
- Significantly lower deposits (1/100) than the relay chain. This includes the existential deposit
  and deposits for proxy/multisig operations.
- Ability to pay transaction fees in certain assets. As in, accounts would **not** need DOT to exist
  on-chain or pay fees.

The Asset Hub will use DOT as its native currency. Users can transfer DOT from the relay chain into
the Asset Hub and use it natively. The relay chain will also accept DOT transfers from the Asset Hub
back to the relay chain for staking, governance, or any other activity.

Using the Asset Hub for DOT/KSM balance transfers will be much more efficient than the relay chain
and is highly recommended. Until domain-specific parachains are built, the relay chain will still
need to be used for staking and governance.

## Assets Basics

See the
[Assets pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/assets) for
the most up-to-date info and reference documentation.

Assets are stored as a map from an ID to information about the asset, including a management team,
total supply, total number of accounts, its sufficiency for account existence, and more.
Additionally, the asset owner can register metadata like the name, symbol, and number of decimals
for representation.

Some assets, as determined by on-chain governance, are regarded as ‚Äúsufficient‚Äù. Sufficiency means
that the asset balance is enough to create the account on-chain, with no need for the DOT/KSM
existential deposit. Likewise, you cannot send a non-sufficient asset to an account that does not
exist. Sufficient assets can be used to pay transaction fees (i.e. there is no need to hold DOT/KSM
on the account).

Assets do have a minimum balance (set by the creator), and if an account drops below that balance,
the dust is lost.

### Asset Operations

The Assets pallet has its interface for dealing with assets. See the [Integration](#integration)
section below for how to fetch information and construct transactions.

The main functions you will probably interact with are `transfer` and `transfer_keep_alive`. These
functions transfer some `amount` (balance) of an `AssetId` (a `u32`, not a contract address) to
another account.

The Assets pallet also provides an `approve_transfer`, `cancel_approval`, and `transfer_approved`
interface for non-custodial operations.

Asset transfers will result in an `assets.transferred` event. The same instructions for
[monitoring events and **not** transactions](build-protocol-info.md#events) applies to asset
transfers.

Note that you can use the same addresses (except
[pure proxies](../learn/learn-proxies-pure.md#anonymous-proxy-pure-proxy)!) on the Asset Hub that
you use on the relay chain. The SS58 encodings are the same; only the chain information (genesis
hash, etc.) will change on transaction construction.

#### Paying Transaction Fees in Another Asset

Users in the Asset Hub can pay the fees of their transactions with assets other than DOT. The only
requirement is that a liquidity pool of the relevant asset against DOT should already exist as a
storage entry of [the Asset Conversion pallet](../learn/learn-asset-conversion-assethub.md).

Technically speaking, this is enabled by
[the `ChargeAssetTxPayment` signed-extension](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/blob/bb52c327360d1098d3b3d36f4eafb40a74636e80/system-parachains/asset-hubs/asset-hub-polkadot/src/lib.rs#L1016)
implemented in the Asset Hub runtime. This signed-extension extends transactions to include an
optional `AssetId` that specifies the asset to be used for payment of both the execution fees and
the optional tip. It defaults to the native token when it is set to `None`. In case it is given,
this `AssetId` has to be an
[XCM `Multilocation`](../learn/learn/xcm/fundamentals/multilocation-summary). Once the transaction
is executed in the block, it will emit an `AssetTxFeePaid` event, informing of the account paying
the fees, the amount in the asset paid as fee, the tip (if any), and the asset ID of the asset
paying the fees.

**Handling Pools with Low Liquidity**

Wallets and UIs enabling this functionality should ensure that the user is prompted with the
necessary warnings, such that they do not accidentally spend all of their funds to perform a swap on
a pool with no or low liquidity.

##### How to Build Transactions Paying Fees with Other Assets

- [This repository](https://github.com/bee344/asset-conversion-example/tree/main) contains the
  complete workflow on how to create a liquidity pool for a given asset, add liquidity to it and
  then build a transaction to pays fees with this asset (including fees estimation). It is done with
  several libraries: Polkadot-JS API and Subxt.
- [Example using Asset Transfer API](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api/blob/main/examples/polkadot/assetHub/paysWithFeeOriginTransfers/dotToHydrationPaysWithGLMR.ts)
  to do a cross-chain transfer in Polkadot Asset Hub paying fees with GLMR.
- [A simple script](https://github.com/bee344/asset-hub-examples/blob/main/polkadot-js-example/src/foreignAssetTransferWithFee.ts)
  using Polkadot-JS API to do a local transfer of bridged KSM in Polkadot Asset Hub paying fees with
  USDT.

### Foreign Assets

Foreign assets are those assets in Asset Hub whose native blockchain is not Asset Hub. These are
mainly native tokens from other parachains or bridged tokens from other consensus systems (such as
Ethereum). Once a foreign asset has been registered in Asset Hub (by its root origin), users are
enabled to send this token from its native blockchain to Asset Hub and operate with it as if it were
any other asset.

Practically speaking, foreign assets are handled by the `foreign-assets` pallet in Asset Hub, which
is an instance of the Assets pallet. Hence, this pallet exposes the same interface to users and
other pallets as the Assets pallet.

The main difference to take into account for foreign assets is their identifier. Instead of using
integers as identifiers like in the Assets pallet, assets stored in the `foreign-assets` pallet are
identified by
[their XCM multilocation](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn/xcm/fundamentals/multilocation-summary).

## Integration

The Asset Hub will come with the same tooling suite that Parity Technologies provides for the Relay
Chain, namely [API Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar) and
[TxWrapper Polkadot](https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core/tree/main/packages/txwrapper-polkadot),
as well as the [Asset Transfer API](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api). If you have a
technical question or issue about how to use one of the integration tools, please file a GitHub
issue so a developer can help.

### Parachain Node

Using the Asset Hub will require running a parachain node to sync the chain. This is very similar to
running a relay chain node, with the addition of some extra flags. You can follow
[these guidelines](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/cumulus#asset-hub-) to set
up an Asset Hub node.

### Asset Transfer API

Asset-transfer-api is a library focused on simplifying the construction of asset transfers for
Substrate-based chains that involve system parachains like Asset Hub (Polkadot and Kusama). It
exposes a reduced set of methods that facilitate users to send transfers to other (para) chains or
locally. You can refer to
[this table](https://github.com/paritytech/asset-transfer-api/tree/main#current-cross-chain-support)
for the current cross-chain support and [here](https://paritytech.github.io/asset-transfer-api/) for
the complete documentation, including installation guide and usage examples.

### Sidecar

API Sidecar is a REST service for relay chain and parachain nodes. It comes with endpoints to query
information about assets and asset balances on the Asset Hub.

- Asset lookups always use the `AssetId` to refer to an asset class. On-chain metadata is subject to
  change and thus unsuitable as a canonical index.
- Please refer to [docs](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist/) for full usage
  information. Details on options like how to make a historical query are not included here.

Here are the available public instances:

- [Sidecar connected to Polkadot Asset Hub](https://polkadot-asset-hub-public-sidecar.parity-chains.parity.io)
  and
- [Sidecar connected to Kusama Asset Hub](https://kusama-asset-hub-public-sidecar.parity-chains.parity.io)

The purpose of these instances is to allow anyone to check and get a quick overview of the info that
the asset-related endpoints provide.

:::caution

These instances should only be used for ad-hoc checks or tests and not for production, heavy testing
or any other critical purpose.

:::

### Tx Wrapper Polkadot

TxWrapper Polkadot is a library designed to facilitate transaction construction and signing in
offline environments. It comes with asset-specific functions to use on the Asset Hub. When
constructing parachain transactions, you can use `txwrapper-polkadot` exactly as on the relay chain,
but construct transactions with the appropriate parachain metadata like genesis hash, spec version,
and type registry.

### XCM Transfer Monitoring

#### Monitoring of XCM deposits

Thanks to XCM and a growing number of parachains, the relay chain native token can exist across
several blockchains, which means the providers need to monitor cross-chain transfers on top of local
transfers and corresponding `balances.transfer` events.

Currently, DOT can be sent and received in the relay chain and in the Asset Hub either with a
[Teleport](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-teleport) from
[system parachains](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-system-chains) or with a
[Reserve Backed Transfer](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm-pallet#transfer-reserve-vs-teleport)
from any other parachain. In both cases, the event emitted when processing the transfer is the
`balances.minted` event. Hence, providers should listen to these events, pointing to an address in
their system. For this, the service provider must query every new block created, loop through the
events array, filter for any `balances.minted` event, and apply the appropriate business logic.

#### Tracking back XCM information

What has been mentioned earlier should be sufficient to confirm that DOT has arrived in a given
account via XCM. However, in some cases, it may be interesting to identify the cross-chain message
that emitted the relevant `balances.minted` event. This can be done as follows:

1. Query the relevant chain `at` the block the `balances.minted` event was emitted.
2. Filter for `messageQueue(Processed)` events. These can be emitted during any phase of the block,
   not just initialization. This event has a parameter `Id`. The value of `Id` identifies the
   cross-chain message received in the relay chain or in the Asset Hub. It can be used to track back
   the message in the origin parachain if needed. Note that a block may contain several
   `messageQueue(Processed)` events corresponding to several cross-chain messages processed for this
   block.

#### Additional Examples of Monitoring XCM Transfers

The two previous sections outline the process of monitoring XCM deposits to specific account(s) and
then tracing back the origin of these deposits. However, the process of tracking an XCM transfer
(hence the events to look for) may vary based on the direction of the XCM message. Here are some
examples to showcase the slight differences:

1. For an XCM transfer from a Parachain to a relay chain
   _([example](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_message/polkadot-3effaf637dd2a3ac5a644ccc693cbf58a6957d84))_:

   - The [event](https://hydradx.subscan.io/extrinsic/5136464-2?event=5136464-7) to look for in the
     Parachain side is called `parachainsystem (UpwardMessageSent)`, and the parameter
     `message_hash` in this event identifies the XCM transfer.
   - The [event](https://polkadot.subscan.io/block/20810935?tab=event&&event=20810935-4) to track in
     the relay chain side is called `messagequeue (Processed)`, and the parameter `id` of the event
     should be the same as the `message_hash` found in the Parachain event.

2. For an XCM transfer from a relay chain to a parachain
   _([example](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_message/polkadot-b2f455ed6ca1b4fdea746dfe8d150c10ec74440e))_:

   - The [event](https://polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/20810793-2?event=20810793-53) to look for in
     the relay chain side is called `xcmPallet (sent)`, and the parameter `message_id` in this event
     identifies the XCM transfer.
   - The [event](https://moonbeam.subscan.io/extrinsic/6174523-0?event=6174523-5) to look for in the
     Parachain side is called `dmpqueue (ExecutedDownward)`, and the parameter that identifies the
     XCM message is either called `message_hash` or `message_id`.

3. For an XCM transfer from a System Parachain to a Parachain
   _([example](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_message/polkadot-72ed4496d1cb793e10084170548d5caf622ea338))_:

   - The [event](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/6275027-4?event=6275027-22) to look
     for in the System Parachain side is called `xcmpqueue (XcmpMessageSent)`, and again the
     `message_hash` is one of the parameters of the event.
   - The corresponding [event](https://hydradx.subscan.io/extrinsic/5135860-1?event=5135860-6) in
     the Parachain side is the `xcmpqueue (Success)` and the `message_hash` found in that event
     should have the same value as the one in the System parachain.

#### Monitoring of Failed XCM Transfers

In case that an XCM transfer fails to complete successfully, then we will notice some different
parameters in the events emitted or different events. Below are some examples:

1. From a relay chain to a System Parachain
   _([example](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_message/polkadot-c8d7186edb43a592d65b3b5a87c4ecaac38c5aa2))_:

   - We will see the
     [event](https://assethub-polkadot.subscan.io/extrinsic/4671081-0?event=4671081-1)
     `dmpqueue (ExecutedDownward)` in the System Parachain side with the following parameters:
     - `outcome` with value `Incomplete` and with the type of error which in this example is
       [UntrustedReserveLocation](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/c54ea64af43b522d23bfabb8d917a490c0f23217/polkadot/xcm/src/v2/traits.rs#L43).
     - `message_id` which shows the hash of the XCM Transfer.

2. From a Parachain to another Parachain
   _([example](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_message/polkadot-3e74e95204faa6ecf3c81f5129b85f498b89cff2))_:

   - We will see the [event](https://interlay.subscan.io/extrinsic/3627057-1?event=3627057-8)
     `xcmpqueue (Fail)` in the destination Parachain with the following parameters:
     - `error` which in this example is
       [TooExpensive](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/c54ea64af43b522d23bfabb8d917a490c0f23217/polkadot/xcm/src/v2/traits.rs#L98).
     - `message_hash` which identifies the XCM Transfer.
   - **Note**: there might be another
     [event](https://interlay.subscan.io/extrinsic/3627057-1?event=3627057-7) called
     `polkadotxcm (AssetsTrapped)` which indicates that some assets have been trapped (and hence can
     be claimed).

A great resource to learn more about Error Management in XCM is the Polkadot blog post from Gavin
Wood,

Welcome to the Polkadot integration guide. This guide will provide all the information you need to
get started on your integration. The target audiences for this guide are wallets and custodians, but
it will be useful to any infrastructure provider such as validators or chain indexers.

## Structure

The guide focuses on Polkadot and Kusama, but the principles will apply to parachains and other
Substrate-based chains. The guide contains four sections:

1. [Protocol Info](build-protocol-info.md): The entry point to the guide. Please read it carefully
   as it provides information about Polkadot that differentiates it from other blockchains. Use this
   page to check your assumptions.
1. [Assets](build-integrate-assets.md): The guide to integrating assets on Polkadot into your
   systems.
1. [Node Management](build-node-management.md): This page will guide you to starting and monitoring
   a node.
1. [Node Interaction](build-node-interaction.md): This page will teach you to interact with your
   node via multiple RPC tooling options.
1. [Transaction Construction](build-transaction-construction.md): A guide to transaction
   construction, signing, decoding, and serialization using several available tools.

## Recommendation

Each page in the guide, especially the Node Interaction and Transaction Construction pages, tries to
list several options to accomplish the same thing. We want you to know your options and choose the
solution that is best for you.

That said, the easiest path to integration is almost always to use
[Substrate API Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar) to interact with your
node and [TxWrapper Core](https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core/) to construct and sign
transactions. Parity and Web3 Foundation will be able to provide the best support if you use these
tools.

If your team would like support, join some of our [community channels](../general/community.md) or
contact support@polkadot.network.

## Blockchain User Interfaces are still Centralized

The communication between a standard user interface (UI) and a network node is through a JSON RPC
protocol. Generally, the UI will showcase the information that is available on the node, and this is
done through two main approaches:

1. **User-Controlled Nodes**: The UI connects to a node client that the user has installed on their
   machine.
   - These nodes are secure, but installation and maintenance of these nodes tend to be an
     inconvenience.
2. **Publicly-Accessible Nodes**: The UI connects to a third-party-owned publicly-accessible node
   client.
   - While these nodes are more prevalent in their usage as they are convenient to use, they are
     centralized and insecure.

There is now a new paradigm: instead of specifying a centralized RPC node, developers just need to
define the blockchain's [chain specification](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/chain-spec/)
for their application to synchronize with the chain. This is possible with Substrate connect.

## What is Substrate Connect?

### Replacing [RPC node](build-node-interaction.md) reliance with light clients

[Substrate connect](https://substrate.io/substrate-connect/) is a JavaScript library and browser
extension that builds on the [PolkadotJS API](https://polkadot.js.org/api/) to enable developers to
build application-specific light clients for Substrate chains. There is no installation required or
optional extension with minimal or no maintenance. The node is run by the JavaScript engine.

Simply put, Substrate connect is a Substrate client that runs in JavaScript.

Application developers no longer need to rely on single RPC nodes to allow end-users to interact
with their applications.

### Substrate (full node) vs. Substrate connect (light client)

A light client lets you utilize all basic features of the chain such as fetching data and
transferring tokens, but it does not require you to run a full copy of the entire blockchain or
having to trust remote peers. Light clients fetch the required data that they need from a Polkadot
node with an associated proof to validate the data.

| Substrate: Full node                                                                                        | Substrate connect: Light client                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

## How to use Substrate Connect

### As a JavaScript library

Substrate connect provides a PolkadotJS API connected to a bundled node. Through the use of the
library, a user can run an actual Substrate-compatible node.

#### A node bundled with its user interface: ready-to-use light clients

The UI connects to a node client that is directly integrated: **convenient**, **secure**, and
**decentralized**. This is accomplished through Substrate connect using a
[smoldot](https://github.com/smol-dot/smoldot) Wasm light client to securely connect to the
blockchain network without relying on specific third parties.

Application developers can now run a Substrate light client in any NodeJS environment
([@substrate/connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@substrate/connect)). Currently, Substrate
connect supports Polkadot, Kusama, and Westend; because light clients are part of the overall
Substrate framework, they are available for Substrate-based blockchains.

### As a browser extension

Establishing a sufficient number of peers is difficult due to browser limitations on WebSockets from
HTTPS pages, as many nodes need to be available with TLS. The browser extension provided by
Substrate connect helps to overcome this limitation and keeps the chains synced in the background,
allowing applications to run faster.

#### Bundling light-clients of multiple chains

The [browser extension](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@substrate/connect-extension-protocol) allows
end-users to interact with applications connected to multiple blockchains or connect their own
blockchains to applications that support it.

:::note

Substrate Connect will auto-detect whether a user is using the extension. If not, the Wasm light
client will be created in-page for them.

## Polkadot Ecosystem Networks

- Mainnet: **Polkadot**
- Canary network: **Kusama**
  - [Kusama](https://kusama.network/) is a value-bearing canary network that gets features before
    Polkadot does. _Expect Chaos_.
- Official testnets:
  - **Westend** - Functionality equal to the current Polkadot mainnet, with possible next-generation
    testing of features from time to time that will eventually migrate onto Polkadot. Perma-testnet
    (is not reset back to genesis block).
  - **Paseo** - A community-run testnet which mirrors the Polkadot runtime. It is maintained by the
    community.

Polkadot mainnet has been running since May 2020 and has
[implementations in various programming languages](../learn/learn-implementations.md) ranging from
Rust to JavaScript. The leading implementation is built in Rust and uses the Substrate framework.

Tooling is rapidly evolving to interact with the network; there are many ways to get started!

But before you jump head-first into the code, you should consider the _kind_ of decentralized
application you want to make and understand the different paradigms available to developers who want
to build on Polkadot.

## Interfacing - PolkadotJS

PolkadotJS is the most widely used developer tool in the Polkadot ecosystem. It provides a web app
to interact with various parachains, nodes, and their RPCs, as well as a Javascript API for use
within front-end contexts. You can view more on PolkadotJS and its resources
[here](https://polkadot.js.org/).

For other programmatic ways of interacting with these networks (including PolkadotJS), please view
the [Node Interactions page](./build-node-interaction.md).

## Testnet Faucets

Almost all tesnets either have a web-based interface for getting test currency or a Matrix room
which you can post `!drip <ADDRESS>`

slug: ../build-node-interaction
---

This page will guide you through some basic interactions with your node. This guide should _guide
you to the proper tools,_ not be seen as canonical reference. Always refer to the proper
documentation for the tool you are using:

- [Substrate RPC API](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/sc_rpc_api/index.html)
- [Polkadot-JS RPC](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/substrate/rpc)
- [Substrate API Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar)

**Polkadot-JS RPC** is a JavaScript library for interacting with the **Substrate RPC API** endpoint,
distributed as `@polkadot/api` Node.js package.  
**Substrate API Sidecar** is using the **Polkadot-JS RPC** to provide separately runnable REST
services.

## Polkadot RPC

The Parity Polkadot client exposes HTTP and WS endpoints for RPC connections. The default ports are
9933 for HTTP and 9944 for WS.

To get a list of all RPC methods, the node has an RPC endpoint called `rpc_methods`.

For example, using [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat#installation):

```bash
echo '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"rpc_methods","params":[]}' | websocat -n1 -B 99999999 ws://127.0.0.1:9944

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"methods":["account_nextIndex","author_hasKey","author_hasSessionKeys","author_insertKey","author_pendingExtrinsics","author_removeExtrinsic","author_rotateKeys","author_submitAndWatchExtrinsic","author_submitExtrinsic","author_unwatchExtrinsic","babe_epochAuthorship","beefy_getFinalizedHead","beefy_subscribeJustifications","beefy_unsubscribeJustifications","chain_getBlock","chain_getBlockHash","chain_getFinalisedHead","chain_getFinalizedHead","chain_getHead","chain_getHeader","chain_getRuntimeVersion","chain_subscribeAllHeads","chain_subscribeFinalisedHeads","chain_subscribeFinalizedHeads","chain_subscribeNewHead","chain_subscribeNewHeads","chain_subscribeRuntimeVersion","chain_unsubscribeAllHeads","chain_unsubscribeFinalisedHeads","chain_unsubscribeFinalizedHeads","chain_unsubscribeNewHead","chain_unsubscribeNewHeads","chain_unsubscribeRuntimeVersion","childstate_getKeys","childstate_getKeysPaged","childstate_getKeysPagedAt","childstate_getStorage","childstate_getStorageEntries","childstate_getStorageHash","childstate_getStorageSize","grandpa_proveFinality","grandpa_roundState","grandpa_subscribeJustifications","grandpa_unsubscribeJustifications","mmr_generateBatchProof","mmr_generateProof","offchain_localStorageGet","offchain_localStorageSet","payment_queryFeeDetails","payment_queryInfo","state_call","state_callAt","state_getChildReadProof","state_getKeys","state_getKeysPaged","state_getKeysPagedAt","state_getMetadata","state_getPairs","state_getReadProof","state_getRuntimeVersion","state_getStorage","state_getStorageAt","state_getStorageHash","state_getStorageHashAt","state_getStorageSize","state_getStorageSizeAt","state_queryStorage","state_queryStorageAt","state_subscribeRuntimeVersion","state_subscribeStorage","state_traceBlock","state_trieMigrationStatus","state_unsubscribeRuntimeVersion","state_unsubscribeStorage","subscribe_newHead","sync_state_genSyncSpec","system_accountNextIndex","system_addLogFilter","system_addReservedPeer","system_chain","system_chainType","system_dryRun","system_dryRunAt","system_health","system_localListenAddresses","system_localPeerId","system_name","system_nodeRoles","system_peers","system_properties","system_removeReservedPeer","system_reservedPeers","system_resetLogFilter","system_syncState","system_unstable_networkState","system_version","unsubscribe_newHead"],"version":1},"id":1}

```

Note that this call will show even those RPC methods which are disabled by a safety flag like
`--rpc-methods Safe`. This is
[being worked on](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/7024).

Add parameters in the call, for example get a block by its hash value:

Some return values may not appear meaningful at first glance. Polkadot uses
[SCALE encoding](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/scale-codec/) as a format that is suitable for
resource-constrained execution environments. You will need to decode the information and use the
chain [metadata](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subxt/#metadata)
(`state_getMetadata`) to obtain human-readable information.

### Tracking the Chain Head

Use the RPC endpoint `chain_subscribeFinalizedHeads` to subscribe to a stream of hashes of finalized
headers, or `chain_FinalizedHeads` to fetch the latest hash of the finalized header. Use
`chain_getBlock` to get the block associated with a given hash. `chain_getBlock` only accepts block
hashes, so if you need to query intermediate blocks, use `chain_getBlockHash` to get the block hash
from a block number.

## Substrate API Sidecar

Parity maintains an RPC client, written in TypeScript, that exposes a limited set of endpoints. It
handles the metadata and codec logic so that you are always dealing with decoded information. It
also aggregates information that an infrastructure business may need for accounting and auditing,
e.g. transaction fees.

The sidecar can fetch blocks, get the balance of an address atomically (i.e., with a corresponding
block number), get the chain's metadata, get a transaction fee prediction, calculate outstanding
staking rewards for an address, submit transactions to a node's transaction queue, and
[much more](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate-api-sidecar/dist/).

The client runs on an HTTP host. The following examples use python3, but you can query any way you
prefer at `http://HOST:PORT/`. The default is `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

### Fetching a Block

Fetch a block using the `block/number` endpoint. To get the chain tip, omit the block number.

```python
import requests
import json

url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/blocks/7409038'
response = requests.get(url)
if response.ok:
	block_info = json.loads(response.text)
	print(block_info)
```

This returns a fully decoded block.

In the `balances.transfer` extrinsic, the `partialFee` item is the transaction fee. It is called
"partial fee" because the [total fee](build-protocol-info.md#fees) would include the `tip` field.
Notice that some extrinsics do not have a signature. These are
[inherents](build-protocol-info.md#extrinsics).

:::info Tracking transaction fees

When tracking transaction fees, the `extrinsics.paysFee` value is not sufficient for determining if
the extrinsic had a fee. This field only means that it would require a fee if submitted as a
transaction. In order to charge a fee, a transaction also needs to be signed. So in the following
example, the `timestamp.set` extrinsic does not pay a fee because it is an _inherent,_ put in the
block by the block author.

### Submitting a Transaction

Submit a serialized transaction using the `transaction` endpoint with an HTTP POST request.

```python
import requests
import json

url = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/transaction/'
tx_headers = {'Content-type' : 'application/json', 'Accept' : 'text/plain'}
response = requests.post(
	url,
	data='{"tx": "0xed0...000"}', # A serialized tx.
	headers=tx_headers
)
tx_response = json.loads(response.text)
```

If successful, this endpoint returns a JSON with the transaction hash. In case of error, it will
return an error report, e.g.:

```
{
    "error": "Failed to parse a tx" | "Failed to submit a tx",
    "cause": "Upstream error description"
}
```

This page contains basic information about running a Parity Polkadot client. There are a lot of ways
to obtain/run a client, e.g. compiling from source, running in Docker, or downloading a binary. This
guide will always refer to the executable as `polkadot`.

**Always refer to the client's help `polkadot --help` for the most up-to-date information.**

[here](../maintain/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot.md).

## Basic Node Operations

**Selecting a chain**

Use the `--chain <chainspec>` option to select the chain. Can be `polkadot`, `kusama`, `westend`, or
a custom chain spec. By default, the client will start Polkadot. Watch
[How a single codebase can power four different blockchains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9vNCHz6wO4)
to learn more about how the chain selection works internally.

**Archive node**

An archive node does not prune any block or state data. Use the `--pruning archive` flag. Certain
types of nodes like validators must run in archive mode. Likewise, all
[events](build-protocol-info.md/#events) are cleared from state in each block, so if you want to
store events then you will need an archive node.

:::note Explainer video on upgrading a node

To upgrade a node, please refer to this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LtcdBR9F40&list=PLOyWqupZ-WGuAuS00rK-pebTMAOxW41W8&index=5)

:::

**Exporting blocks**

To export blocks to a file, use `export-blocks`. Export in JSON (default) or binary
(`--binary true`).

```bash
polkadot export-blocks --from 0 <output_file>
```

**RPC ports**

Use the `--rpc-external` flag to expose RPC ports. Not all RPC calls are safe to allow and you
should use an RPC proxy to filter unsafe calls. Select ports with the `--rpc-port` option. To limit
the hosts who can access, use the `--rpc-cors` option.

**Execution**

The Parity Polkadot client implements a [Polkadot Host](../learn/learn-polkadot-host.md) and a
native runtime. The runtime must compile to WebAssembly and is stored on-chain. If the client's
runtime is the same spec as the runtime that is stored on-chain, then the client will execute blocks
using the client binary. Otherwise, the client will execute the Wasm runtime from the chain.

Therefore, when syncing the chain, the client will execute blocks from past runtimes using their
associated Wasm binary. This feature also allows forkless upgrades: the client can execute a new
runtime without updating the client.

Parity's Polkadot client has two Wasm execution methods, interpreted (default) and compiled. Set the
preferred method to use when executing Wasm with `--wasm-execution <Interpreted|Compiled>`. Compiled
execution will run much faster, especially when syncing the chain, but is experimental and may use
more memory/CPU. A reasonable tradeoff would be to sync the chain with compiled execution and then
restart the node with interpreted execution.

## File Structure

The node stores a number of files in: `/home/$USER/.local/share/polkadot/chains/<chain name>/`. You
can set a custom path with `--base-path <path>`.

**`keystore`**

The keystore stores session keys, which are important for validator operations.

- [Polkadot documentation](../learn/learn-cryptography.md)
- [Substrate documentation](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/fundamentals/accounts-addresses-keys/#specialized-accounts)

**`db`**

The database stores blocks and the state trie. If you are running a validator node, it also stores
GRANDPA pre-votes and pre-commits and the offchain-worker DB. Use caution when
[migrating validator nodes](../maintain/maintain-guides-how-to-upgrade.md) to avoid equivocation. If
you want to start a new machine without resyncing, you can stop your node, back up the DB, and move
it to a new machine.

To delete your DB and re-sync from genesis, run:

```bash
polkadot purge-chain
```

:::note Validators should sync using the RocksDb backend

This is implicit by default, but can be explicit by passing the `--database RocksDb` flag. In the
future, it is recommended to switch to using the faster and more efficient ParityDb option.
Switching between database backends will require a resync.

If you want to test out ParityDB you can add the flag `--database paritydb`.

:::

## Monitoring and Telemetry

**Node status**

You can check the node's health via RPC with
[websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat#installation):

```bash
echo '{"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"system_health","params":[]}' | websocat -n1 -B 99999999 ws://127.0.0.1:9944

{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":{"peers":50,"isSyncing":false,"shouldHavePeers":true},"id":1}
```

**Logs**

The Polkadot client has a number of log targets. The most interesting to users may be:

- `afg` (Al's Finality Gadget - GRANDPA consensus)
- `babe`
- `telemetry`
- `txpool`
- `usage`

Other targets include:
`db, gossip, peerset, state-db, state-trace, sub-libp2p, trie, wasm-executor, wasm-heap`.

The log levels, from least to most verbose, are:

- `error`
- `warn`
- `info`
- `debug`
- `trace`

All targets are set to `info` logging by default. You can adjust individual log levels using the
`--log (-l short)` option, for example `-l afg=trace,sync=debug` or globally with `-ldebug`.

**Telemetry & Metrics**

The Parity Polkadot client connects to telemetry by default. You can disable it with
`--no-telemetry`, or connect only to specified telemetry servers with the `--telemetry-url` option
(see the help options for instructions). Connecting to public telemetry may expose information that
puts your node at higher risk of attack. You can run your own, private
[telemetry server](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-telemetry) or deploy a
`substrate-telemetry` instance to a Kubernetes cluster using
[this Helm chart](https://github.com/w3f/substrate-telemetry-chart).

The node also exposes a Prometheus endpoint by default (disable with `--no-prometheus`). Substrate
has a
[monitor node metrics tutorial](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/get-started/monitor-node-metrics/)
which uses this endpoint.

slug: ../build-oracle
---

In the blockchain context, an _oracle_ is a way to bring real-world data onto the blockchain so that
it can be used by a decentralized application.

Oracles serve many purposes for application builders. For example:

- Most stablecoin designs use an oracle to bring in data of the exchange rate of assets, in order to
  peg their value to a real world currency.
- Synthetic assets use oracles as price feeds in order to determine if the underlying cryptocurrency
  can sufficiently collateralize the debt position.
- Prediction markets use oracles to decide the outcome of real world events and determine the payout
  of the prediction shares.
- Decentralized insurance markets use oracles to bring in information about whether a claim is valid
  or not.

Oracle solutions range from centralized and trusted to decentralized and game-theory based. On the
centralized end of the spectrum, an oracle could be a single account that has the authority to
dictate the real-world data on-chain. On the decentralized end, a
[complex game of "chicken"](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/)
can be played among various staked actors who risk getting slashed if they don't submit the same
data as everyone else. Solutions such as
[Chainlink](https://polkadot.network/chainlink-reaches-milestone-with-polkadot/) fit somewhere in
the middle, where the amount of trust you put into the reporting oracles can be adjusted based on
your preferences. A Chainlink
[Feed Pallet](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink-polkadot/blob/master/pallet-chainlink-feed/README.md)
was recently released to allow smart contract applications across Polkadot to access price reference
data, made available as a Substrate oracle pallet. [Acurast](https://acurast.com/) is another
solution that enables developers to define their off-chain data and computation requirements and
receive the outputs to the [Acurast Pallet](https://docs.acurast.com/integrations/substrate) and EVM
or WASM environments.

When using an oracle in your application you should be aware of the benefits and risks that are
baked into its specific model. As the Polkadot ecosystem develops and oracle parachains begin to
appear, this article will be updated with a comparison of the different solutions and the benefits
and drawbacks that each provide.

title: Parachain Development
sidebar_label: Parachain Development
description: A guide on what it means to become a Parachain and the steps to do so.
keywords: [build, parachain, develop, implement, PDK]
slug: ../build-pdk
---

Parachains are connected to and secured by the relay chain. They benefit from the _pooled security_,
_thought-through governance_, and overall _scalability_ of the heterogeneous sharding approach of
the network. Creating a parachain can be seen as creating a **Layer-1 blockchain**, which has its
own logic and runs in parallel within the Polkadot ecosystem.

Developers can focus on creating state-of-the-art chains that take advantage of Polkadot's
next-generation approach. Some examples of what a parachain could be are:

- DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Applications
- Digital Wallets
- IoT (Internet of Things) Applications
- Gaming
- Web 3.0 Infrastructure

and more.

Polkadot aims to be a bet against blockchain maximalism, where the success of Polkadot's
heterogeneous multi-chain approach will play a key part in the overall advancement of Web 3.0 and
decentralized systems. As a result, Polkadot's parachain model was designed with the belief that the
internet of the future will have many different types of blockchains working together.

### What are the Benefits of Deploying a Parachain?

The parachain model attempts to alleviate five key _build_ failures of present technology stacks, as
described in the [Polkadot Whitepaper](https://polkadot.network/PolkaDotPaper.pdf):

- **Scalability**: How much is spent on resources and will the network be subject to bottlenecks?
- **Isolatability**: Are the needs of many accounted for under the same framework?
- **Developability**: Is the system tooling, system support, and overall system integrity
  dependable?
- **Governance**: Can the network remain flexible to evolve and adapt over time? Can decisions be
  made with sufficient inclusivity, legitimacy, and transparency to provide effective leadership of
  a decentralised system?
- **Applicability**: Does the technology address a burning need on its own? Is other ‚Äúmiddleware‚Äù
  required to bridge the gap to actual applications?

#### [Shared Security](../learn/learn-parachains.md) (Pooled Security)

Parachains can lease the security and interoperability of the Polkadot network purchasing coretime
with [DOT](../learn/learn-DOT.md). This means that the social costs of building a community around
your project and convincing validators to participate in your network security are reduced. Polkadot
has strong security, and decentralised application projects wishing to benefit from this security
would want to become a parachain to share in that pooled security.

#### [On-Chain Governance](../learn/learn-polkadot-opengov.md) (Thought-through Governance)

Most governance systems in blockchains use an off-chain governance mechanism. Polkadot's on-chain
governance encourages maximum participation of token holders and is frictionless and transparent. It
also enables [forkless upgrades](../learn/learn-runtime-upgrades.md).

#### Scalability

The sharded multichain network approach allows for what is essentially parallel computation
(processing power) that can process several transactions in parallel. Isolated blockchains are often
faced with the network constraint of processing transactions in sequence, causing bottlenecks.

#### Interoperability

Any decentralised application or chain that wants to enable trustless messaging to other parachains
already connected to the relay chain would want to become a parachain. Interoperability between
sovereign chains involves certain constraints and complex protocols to enable across a wide breadth
of chains.

With Polkadot, you will get this feature out of the box if you build your application as a
parachain. The [XCM format](../learn/learn-xcm.md) allows any parachains to communicate by passing
messages between them. Furthermore, as [bridges](../learn/learn-bridges.md) to other chains are
connected (such as those to Bitcoin or Ethereum), Polkadot's parachains will be able to communicate
with these as well.

:::note

Despite the benefits of becoming a parachain, developers should be conscious of the challenges in
becoming a parachain, and whether building a blockchain with an end goal of becoming a parachain is
a viable one for their project.

:::

On Polkadot, you are able to put your blockchain‚Äôs latest block head onto the relay chain. As a
parachain, the blocks you submit are verified by validators with a Wasm runtime, which can be stored
on the relay chain. You also get the ability to communicate with other parachains using the
[XCM](../learn/learn-xcm.md) format: an abstract message passing system. Message passing is tracked
on the relay chain - as such, you can prove the delivery of messages and facilitate trustless
interactions.

As you can place your blockchain‚Äôs latest block head, you can achieve deterministic finalization for
your chain. The hard part of reaching finalization for blockchains tends to be the consensus, where,
in the parachain model, a blockchain can offload consensus to the overall shared network, and focus
on block production. Since the validators have the Wasm runtime for all the parachains, your
parachain shares the security of the validator pool with everyone on the relay chain.

Any validator in the validator pool can help validate your blockchain.

## Things to Consider

### [Para-nomics](../learn/learn-parachains.md#parachain-economies)

#### Digital Nation States

Parachains can be seen as autonomous agents; networks that act as decentralised digital nation
states. Parachains have their own communities, rules, economies, governance, treasuries, and
relationships with external chains. As a result, the economic policies within parachain ecosystems
are subject to the developers and overall community of that parachain ecosystem; there isn't
necessarily a go-to economic model a parachain should follow.

Moreover, _becoming a parachain_ has an opportunity cost associated. Ideally, you can increase the
value of the network by participating in the parachain selection process, and this should serve as a
good return on investment.

#### Connecting Digital Economies

[Collators](../learn/learn-collator.md) act as network maintainers and maintain a full node of a
parachain. They can be incentivized with a native token payout from:

- Transaction fees collected
- Parachain token sponsorship

### Para-objects

:::info The relay chain can host arbitrary state machines, not just blockchains.

The Polkadot network will encourage the connection and interoperability between different
_para-objects_.

Here, para-objects are referring to objects on the network that operate in parallel, generally,
parallelizable objects.

:::

These could be in the form of:

- System level chains (permanent chains)
- [Bridge](../learn/learn-bridges.md) Hubs
- Nested relay chains

### Migration

Projects that are already functioning as "solochains" or in isolated environments may be interested
in migrating onto the relay chain as a para-object. While the parachain model has its benefits, it
may not be the go-to strategy for some projects.

As a path for migration onto Polkadot, it may be more viable to migrate to one of the chains in one
of the reserved cores.

For instance, there are currently options for [smart contract deployment](build-smart-contracts.md)
on Kusama through the networks that have secured [coretime](../learn/learn-agile-coretime.md).

## Implement a Parachain

The Parachain Implementer's Guide is a significant work in progress and maintained by Parity Tech.
[**The live version**](https://w3f.github.io/parachain-implementers-guide/) is built from the source
located in the official
[Polkadot repository](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/polkadot/roadmap/implementers-guide).

### Parachain Development Kit

The Parachain Development Kit or **PDK** is a set of tools that allows developers to easily create a
parachain. In practice, the PDK will consist of the following key components:

- _State transition function_ : a way for your application to move from one state to another state.
- _Collator node_ : a type of peer-to-peer node in the Polkadot network with certain
  responsibilities regarding parachains.

#### Key Components

The state transition function (STF) can be an abstract way for an application to go from one state
to another state. The only constraint that Polkadot places on this STF is that it must be easily
verifiable -- usually through what we call a _witness_ or _proof_. It must be so because the Relay
Chain validators will need to check that each state it receives from the collator node is correct
without actually running through the entire computation. Some examples of these proofs include the
Proof-of-Validity blocks or zk-SNARKs, which require less computational resources to verify than
they do to generate. The verification asymmetry in the proof generation of the STF is one of the
integral insights that allows Polkadot to scale while keeping high-security guarantees.

A collator node is one of the types of network maintainers in the protocol. They are responsible for
**keeping availability** of the state of the parachain and the new states returned from the
iteration of the state transition function. They must remain online to keep track of the state and
also of the XCMP messages that it will route between itself and other parachains. Collator nodes are
responsible for passing the succinct proofs to the relay chain's validators and tracking the latest
blocks from the relay chain. In essence, a collator node also acts as a light client for the relay
chain. For more on collator nodes, see the [collator page](../learn/learn-collator.md).

#### What PDKs Exist?

Currently, the only PDK is
[the Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate) and
[Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/cumulus).

**[Substrate](https://substrate.io/)** is a blockchain framework that provides the basic building
blocks of a blockchain (things like the networking layer, consensus, a Wasm interpreter) while
providing an intuitive way to construct your runtime. Substrate is made to ease the process of
creating a new chain, but it does not provide support for relay chain compatibility directly. For
this reason, `Cumulus`, an added _library_ contains all of the Polkadot compatibility glue code.

#### Cumulus

:::info

Cumulus clouds are shaped sort of like dots. Together, they form an intricate system that is
beautiful and functional.

:::

[Cumulus](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/cumulus) is an extension to
Substrate that makes it easy to make any Substrate-built runtime into a Polkadot-compatible
parachain.

Cumulus Consensus is a consensus engine for Substrate that follows a relay chain. This runs a Relay
Chain node internally, and dictates to the client and synchronization algorithms which chain to
follow, finalize, and treat as correct.

See the
[Cumulus overview](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/cumulus/docs/overview.md)
for a more detailed description of Cumulus.

Cumulus is still in development, but the idea is that it should be simple to take a Substrate chain
and add the parachain code by importing the crates and adding a single line of code. Keep up-to-date
with the latest Cumulus developments from the [Cumulus section](###cumulus).

:::info

Substrate and Cumulus provide a PDK from the abstraction of the blockchain format, but it is **not
necessary** that a parachain even needs to be a blockchain. For example, a parachain just needs to
satisfy the two constraints listed above: _state transition function_ and _collator node_.

Everything else is up to the implementer of the PDK.

:::

Cumulus handles the network compatibility overhead that any parachain would need to implement to be
connected to the relay chain. This includes:

- Cross-chain message passing (XCMP)
- Out-of-the-box Collator node setup
- An embedded full client of the relay chain
- Block authorship compatibility

Are you interested in building a PDK? See the [future PDKs](#future-pdks) section for details.

### How to set up your parachain

After creating your chain runtime logic with Substrate, you will be able to compile it down to a
Wasm executable. This Wasm code blob will contain the entire state transition function of your
chain, and is what you will need to deploy your project to the relay chain as a parachain.

Validators on the relay chain will use the submitted Wasm code to validate the state transitions of
your chain or thread, but doing this requires some additional infrastructure. A validator needs some
way to stay up to date with the most recent state transitions, since relay chain nodes will not be
required to also be nodes of your chain.

This is where the collator node comes into play. A collator is a maintainer of your parachain and
performs the critical action of producing new block candidates for your chain and passing them to
relay chain validators for inclusion in the relay chain.

Substrate comes with its own networking layer built-in but unfortunately only supports solo chains
(that is, chains that do not connect to the relay chain). However, there is the Cumulus extension
that includes a collator node and allows for your Substrate-built logic to be compatible with the
relay chain as a parachain.

### Future PDKs

:::info Call to action

Do you want to build a Parachain Development Kit from scratch? The Web3 Foundation is giving grants
to teams who are doing this, learn more and apply on the
[W3F grants page](https://grants.web3.foundation).

:::

One example of a PDK W3F is interested in supporting is a
[roll-up](https://ethresear.ch/t/roll-up-roll-back-snark-side-chain-17000-tps/3675) kit that allowed
developers to create SNARK-based parachains. If we review the roll-up write-up, we see that the
system uses two roles: users that update **state** and an operator that **aggregates the state
updates** into a single on-chain update. It should be straightforward to see how we can translate
this to the parachain terms. The state transition function for a roll-up-like parachain would be
updating the state (in practice, most likely a Merkle tree, which would be easily verifiable) from
the user inputs. The operator would act as the collator node, which would aggregate the state and
create the zk-SNARK proof that it would hand to a relay chain's validators for verification.

If you or your team are interested in developing a PDK feel free to apply for a grant on the
[W3F Grants Program repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program). There may be grants
available for this type of work.

## Testing a Parachain

### Paseo Testnet

[Paseo](https://github.com/paseo-network) is a testnet built for testing parachains. Paseo utilizes
Cumulus and [HRMP](../learn/learn-xcm-transport.md#hrmp-xcmp-lite) (Horizontal Relay-routed Message
Passing) in order to send transfers and messages between parachains.

Paseo runs a few test [system parachains](../learn/learn-system-chains.md) and externally developed
parachains.

If you would like to start deploying a parachain and trying out Coretime on Paseo, refer to the
[Coretime Guides](../build/build-guides-coretime-start.md).

### What Parachains are on Paseo Now?

You can see the list of included parachains
[here](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fpaseo-rpc.dwellir.com#/parachains).

### Obtaining PAS

Follow the instructions [here](../learn/learn-DOT.md#getting-tokens-on-the-paseo-testnet) to get PAS
tokens.

### How to Connect to a Parachain

If you would like to connect to a parachain via [Polkadot-JS Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/),
you may do so by clicking on the network selection at the top left-hand corner of the navigation and
selecting any parachain of choice.

![paseo parachains](../assets/paseo-chains.png)

For the purpose of these following examples, we will be using the Paseo testnet "Custom Node"
underneath "Development", following the
[parachain and coretime tutorials](../build/build-guides-coretime-start.md).

### Parachain Playground

You can also take advantage of the account functions offered on Polkadot-JS Apps to test the entire
Parachain onboarding process (e.g. registration and coretime purchase).

Start a local node on [Westend](../maintain/maintain-networks.md###westend-test-network) by running:

```bash
polkadot --chain=westend-dev --alice
```

Then, connect your local node with Polkadot-JS Apps.

![parachains playground](../assets/parachain-playground.png)

## Deploy

Substrate-based chains, including the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains, use an
[SS58 encoding](../learn/learn-account-advanced.md#address-format) for their address formats.
[This page](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry/blob/main/ss58-registry.json) serves as the
canonical registry for teams to see which chain corresponds to a given prefix, and which prefixes
are available.

### Parachain

To include your parachain into the Polkadot network, you will need to reserve a core on the relay
chain.

[Coretime](../learn/learn-agile-coretime.md) can be purchased with DOT to produce blocks
[continuously or on-demand](../learn/learn-parachains.md#parachains-vs-on-demand-parachains) while
benefiting from Polkadot's security. See
[these guides](../learn/learn-guides-coretime-marketplaces.md) to learn how to purchase coretime.

  Characteristics about the Polkadot protocol, and what you need to consider when building.
keywords: [build, protocol, extrinsics, events, transaction]
slug: ../build-protocol-info
---

This page serves as a high-level introduction to the Polkadot protocol with terminology that may be
specific to Polkadot, notable differences to other chains that you may have worked with, and
practical information for dealing with the chain.

> If the below does not offer a sufficient amount of information regarding the Polkadot protocol, be
> sure to visit the [Polkadot Spec](https://spec.polkadot.network/id-polkadot-protocol), which is
> more verbose than this Wiki page.

## Tokens

- **Token decimals:**
  - Polkadot (DOT): 10
  - Kusama (KSM): 12
- **Base unit:** "Planck"
- **Balance type:** [`u128`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/u128/index.html)

### Redenomination

Polkadot conducted a poll, which ended on 27 July 2020 (block 888_888), in which the stakeholders
decided to redenominate the DOT token. The redenomination does not change the number of base units
(called "plancks" in Polkadot) in the network. The only change is that a single DOT token will be
1e10 plancks instead of the original 1e12 plancks. See the Polkadot blog posts explaining the
[details](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/the-first-polkadot-vote-1fc1b8bd357b) and the
[results](https://medium.com/polkadot-network/the-results-are-in-8f6b1ca2a4e6) of the vote.

The redenomination took effect 72 hours after transfers were enabled, at block 1_248_326, which
occurred at approximately 16:50 UTC on 21 Aug 2020. You can find more information about the
redenomination [here](../learn/archive/learn-redenomination.md).

## Addresses

In Polkadot (and most Substrate chains), user accounts are identified by a 32-byte (256-bit)
`AccountId`. This is often, but not always, the public key of a cryptographic key pair.

Polkadot (and Substrate) use the SS58 address format. This is a broad "meta-format" designed to
handle many different cryptographic schemes and chains. It has much in common with Bitcoin's
Base58Check format such as a version prefix, a hash-based checksum suffix, and base-58 encoding.

<!-- todo: link to dev hub once up -->

See the
[SS58 page](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/fundamentals/accounts-addresses-keys/#address-encoding-and-chain-specific-addresses)
in the Substrate documentation for encoding information and a more comprehensive list of network
prefixes.

:::warning Do not use regular expressions (regex) to validate addresses

Always verify using the prefix and checksum of the address. Substrate API Sidecar provides an
`accounts/{accountId}/validate` path that returns a boolean `isValid` response for a provided
address.

:::

Relevant SS58 prefixes for this guide:

- Polkadot: 0
- Kusama: 2
- Westend: 42

### Cryptography

Polkadot supports the following [cryptographic](../learn/learn-cryptography.md) key pairs and
signing algorithms:

- Ed25519
- Sr25519 - Schnorr signatures on the Ristretto group
- ECDSA signatures on secp256k1

Note that the address for a secp256k1 key is the SS58 encoding of the _hash of the public key_ in
order to reduce the public key from 33 bytes to 32 bytes.

## Extrinsics and Events

<!-- todo: link to dev hub once up, not sure if this should be here ? -->

### Block Format

A Polkadot block consists of a block header and a block body. The block body is made up of
extrinsics representing the generalization of the concept of transactions. Extrinsics can contain
any external data the underlying chain wishes to validate and track.

The block header is a 5-tuple containing the following elements:

- `parent_hash`: a 32-byte Blake2b hash of the SCALE encoded parent block header.
- `number`: an integer representing the index of the current block in the chain. It is equal to the
  number of the ancestor blocks. The genesis state has number 0.
- `state_root`: the root of the Merkle tree, used as storage for the system.
- `extrinsics_root`: field which is reserved for the Runtime to validate the integrity of the
  extrinsics composing the block body.
- `digest`: field used to store any chain-specific auxiliary data, which could help the light
  clients interact with the block without the need of accessing the full storage as well as
  consensus-related data including the block signature.

A node creating or receiving a block must gossip that block to the network (i.e. to the other
nodes). Other nodes within the network will track this announcement and can request information
about the block. Additional details on the process are outlined
[here](https://spec.polkadot.network/#sect-msg-block-announce) in the Polkadot Spec.

### Extrinsics

An extrinsic is a
[SCALE encoded](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec#parity-scale-codec) array
consisting of a `version number`, `signature`, and varying `data` types indicating the resulting
runtime function to be called, including the parameters required for that function to be executed.

<!-- todo: link to dev hub once up -->

Extrinsics constitute information from the outside world and take on three forms:

- Inherents
- Signed Transactions
- Unsigned Transactions

As an infrastructure provider, you will deal almost exclusively with signed transactions. You will,
however, see other extrinsics within the blocks that you decode. Find more information in the
[Substrate documentation](https://docs.substrate.io/main-docs/build/tx-weights-fees/).

Inherent extrinsics are unsigned and contain information that is not provably true, but validators
agree on based on some measure of reasonability. For example, a timestamp cannot be proved, but
validators can agree that it is within some time difference on their system clock. Inherents are
broadcasted as part of the produced blocks rather than being gossiped as individual extrinsics.

Signed transactions contain a signature of the account that issued the transaction and stands to pay
a fee to have the transaction included on chain. Because the value of including signed transactions
on-chain can be recognized prior to execution, they can be gossiped on the network between nodes
with a low risk of spam. Signed transactions fit the concept of a transaction in Ethereum or
Bitcoin.

Some transactions cannot be signed by a fee-paying account and use unsigned transactions. For
example, when a user claims their DOT from the Ethereum DOT indicator contract to a new DOT address,
the new address doesn't yet have any funds with which to pay fees.

The Polkadot Host does not specify or limit the internals of each extrinsics and those are defined
and dealt with by the Runtime.

### Transaction Mortality

Extrinsics can be mortal or immortal. The transaction payload includes a block number and block hash
checkpoint from which a transaction is valid and a validity period (also called "era" in some
places) that represents the number of blocks after the checkpoint for which the transaction is
valid. If the extrinsic is not included in a block within this validity window, it will be discarded
from the transaction queue.

The chain only stores a limited number of prior block hashes as reference. You can query this
parameter, called [`BlockHashCount`](../general/chain-state-values.md#block-hash-count), from the
chain state or metadata. If the validity period is larger than the number of blocks stored on-chain,
then the transaction will only be valid as long as there is a block to check it against, i.e. the
minimum value of validity period and block hash count.

Setting the block checkpoint to zero, using the genesis hash, and a validity period of zero will
make the transaction "immortal".

**NOTE:** If an account is reaped and a user re-funds the account, then they could replay an
immortal transaction. Always default to using a mortal extrinsic.

### Unique Identifiers for Extrinsics

:::caution Transaction Hash is not a unique identifier

The assumption that a transaction's hash is a unique identifier is the number one mistake that
indexing services and custodians make. This error will cause major issues for your users. Make sure
that you read this section carefully.

:::

Many infrastructure providers on existing blockchains, e.g. Ethereum, consider a transaction's hash
as a unique identifier. In Substrate-based chains like Polkadot, a transaction's hash only serves as
a fingerprint of the information within a transaction, and there are times when two transactions
with the same hash are both valid. In the case that one is invalid, the network properly handles the
transaction and does not charge a transaction fee to the sender nor consider the transaction in the
block's fullness.

Imagine this contrived example with a [reaped account](#existential-deposit). The first and last
transactions are identical, and both valid.

| Index | Hash | Origin    | Nonce | Call                | Results                       |
| :---: | :--: | :-------- | :---: | :------------------ | :---------------------------- |
|   0   | 0x01 | Account A |   0   | Transfer 5 DOT to B | Account A reaped              |
|   1   | 0x02 | Account B |   4   | Transfer 7 DOT to A | Account A created (nonce = 0) |
|   2   | 0x01 | Account A |   0   | Transfer 5 DOT to B | Successful transaction        |

In addition, not every extrinsic in a Substrate-based chain comes from an account as a "pure"
public/private key pair. The concept of dispatch
[‚ÄúOrigin‚Äù](../learn/learn-account-abstraction.md#origin-abstraction-in-polkadot), which could
represent different contexts for a particular, signed extrinsic.

For example, the origin could befrom a public key account, but could also represent a collective.
These origins do not have a nonce associated with them the way that an account does. For example,
governance might dispatch the same call with the same arguments multiple times, like ‚Äúincrease the
validator set by 10%.‚Äù This dispatch information (and therefore its hash) would be the same, and the
hash would be a reliable representative of the call, but its execution would have different effects
depending on the chain‚Äôs state at the time of dispatch.

The correct way to uniquely identify an extrinsic on a Substrate-based chain is to use the block ID
(height or hash) and the extrinsic's index. Substrate defines a block as a header and an array of
extrinsics; therefore, an index in the array at a canonical height will always uniquely identify a
transaction. This methodology is reflected in the Substrate codebase itself, for example to
[reference a previous transaction](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_multisig/struct.Timepoint.html)
from the Multisig pallet.

### Events

While extrinsics represent information from the outside world, events represent information from the
chain. Extrinsics can trigger events. For example, the Staking pallet emits a `Reward` event when
claiming staking rewards to tell the user how much the account was credited.

If you want to monitor deposits into an address, keep in mind that several transactions can initiate
a balance transfer (such as `balances.transferKeepAlive` and a `utility.batch` transaction with a
transfer inside of it). Only monitoring `balances.transfer` transactions will not be sufficient.
Make sure that you monitor events in each block for events that contain your addresses of interest.
Monitor events instead of transaction names to ensure that you can properly credit deposits.

### Fees

Polkadot uses weight-based fees that, unlike gas, are charged _pre-dispatch._ Users can also add a
"tip" to increase transaction priority during congested periods. See the
[transaction fee](../learn/learn-transactions.md#transaction-fees) page for more info.

### Encoding

Parity's integration tools should allow you to deal with decoded data. If you'd like to bypass them
and interact directly with the chain data or implement your own codec, Polkadot encodes block and
transaction data using the
[SCALE codec](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec#parity-scale-codec).

## Runtime Upgrades

[Runtime upgrades](../learn/learn-runtime-upgrades.md) allow Polkadot to change the logic of the
chain without the need for a hard fork. You can find a guide for how to properly perform a runtime
upgrade here.

### Runtime Versioning

<!-- todo: either expand or delete this section -->

There are a number of fields that are a part of the overall
[`RuntimeVersion`](https://paritytech.github.io/polkadot-sdk/master/frame/runtime/apis/struct.RuntimeVersion.html#).

Apart the `runtime_version` there is also the `transaction_version` which denotes how to correctly
encode/decode calls for a given runtime (useful for hardware wallets). The reason
`transaction_version` is separate from `runtime_version` is that it explicitly notes that the call
interface is broken/not compatible.

## Smart Contracts

The Polkadot relay chain does not support smart contracts, but a number of its parachains do,
[see here for more.](./build-smart-contracts.md)

## Other F.A.Q.

**Can an account's balance change without a corresponding, on-chain transaction?**

No, but not all balance changes are in a _transaction,_ some are in _events._ You will need to run
an archive node and listen for events and transactions to track all account activity. This
especially applies to _locking_ operations if you are calculating balance as the spendable balance,
i.e. free balance minus the maximum lock.

**What chain depth is considered "safe"?**

Polkadot uses a deterministic finality mechanism. Once a block is finalized, it cannot be reverted
except by a hard fork. Kusama has had hard forks that had to revert four finalized blocks in order
to cancel a runtime upgrade. Using a finalized depth of ten blocks should be safe.

Note that block production and finality are isolated processes in Polkadot, and the chain can have a
long unfinalized head.

**Do users need to interact with any smart contracts?**

No, users interact directly with the chain's logic.

**Does Polkadot have state rent?**

No, Polkadot uses the existential deposit to prevent dust accounts and other economic mechanisms
like locking or reserving tokens for operations that utilize state.

**What is an external source to see the current chain height?**

title: Smart Contracts
sidebar_label: Smart Contracts
description: How smart contracts play their role in the Polkadot ecosystem.
keywords: [build, smart contract, evm, wasm]
slug: ../build-smart-contracts
---

The relay chain which is a layer 0 blockchain, does not support smart contracts natively. However,
parachains which are layer 1 blockchains are equipped with the functionality to support smart
contracts.

The two primary supported smart contract environments are [ink!](#ink) and EVM. There are multiple
[parachains that support both environments](#parachains).

## Difference between developing a smart contract and a parachain

### Layer of Abstraction

When you write a smart contract, you are creating the instructions that associate with and deploy on
a specific chain address.

In comparison, a runtime module on a parachain is the entire logic of a chain's state transitions
(what's called a state transition function).

Smart contracts must consciously implement upgradeability while parachains have the ability to swap
out their code entirely through a root command or via the governance pallet.

When you build a smart contract, it will eventually be deployed to a target chain with its own
environment. Parachains allow the developer to declare the environment of their own chain, even
allowing others to write smart contracts for it.

### Gas Fees

Smart contracts must find a way to limit their own execution, or else full nodes are vulnerable to
DOS attacks. An infinite loop in a smart contract, for example, could consume the computational
resources of an entire chain, preventing others from using it. The
[halting problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem) shows that even with a powerful
enough language, it is impossible to know ahead of time whether or not a program will ever cease
execution. Some platforms, such as Bitcoin, get around this constraint by providing a very
restricted scripting language. Others, such as Ethereum, "charge" the smart contract "gas" for the
rights to execute their code. If a smart contract does get into a state where execution will never
halt, it eventually runs out of gas, ceases execution, and any state transition that the smart
contract would have made is rolled back.

Parachains can implement arbitrarily powerful programming languages and contain no gas notion for
their own native logic. This means that some functionality is easier to implement for the developer,
but some constructs, such as a loop without a terminating condition, should _never_ be implemented.
Leaving certain logic, such as complex loops that could run indefinitely, to a non-smart contract
layer, or even trying to eliminate it, will often be a wiser choice. Parachains try to be proactive,
while smart contract platforms are event-driven.

Relay chain and parachains typically use the _weight-fee model_ and not a _gas-metering model_.

## Building a Smart Contract

The relay chain does not natively support smart contracts. However, since the parachains that
connect to the relay chain can support arbitrary state transitions, they support smart contracts.

Substrate presently supports smart contracts out-of-the-box in several ways:

- The EVM pallet offered by [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier).
- The
  [Contracts pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/contracts/)
  in the FRAME library for Wasm-based contracts.

### Frontier EVM Contracts

[Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier) is the suite of tools that enables a Substrate
chain to run Ethereum contracts (EVM) natively with the same API/RPC interface, Ethereum exposes on
Substrate. Ethereum Addresses can also be mapped directly to and from Substrate's SS58 scheme from
existing accounts.

### Substrate Contracts

Substrate offers a built-in
[contract pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/master/pallet_contracts/index.html);
parachains can also support [WebAssembly](../learn/learn-wasm.md) smart contracts. Additionally,
there is the [EVM Pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier/tree/master/frame/evm#evm-module),
which allows a parachain to implement the Ethereum Virtual Machine, thereby supporting almost direct
ports of Ethereum contracts.

A video version of the recap of the smart contract situation is available on the
[Polkadot YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKHkFBXaUxQ).

#### Resources

[When should I build a Substrate runtime versus a Substrate smart contract](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56041305)?
This post answers the question more technically of when a developer might choose to develop a
runtime versus a smart contract.

Here is the list of current resources available to developers who want to get started writing smart
contracts to deploy on parachains based on Substrate.

- [ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) - Parity's ink to write smart contracts.
- [Substrate ink! Workshop](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/smart-contracts/) - Walks you
  through the basics of writing and deploying an ERC-20 token using `ink!`.

### Contracts Pallet

The experience of deploying to an EVM-based chain may be more familiar to developers that have
written smart contracts before. However, the Contracts pallet makes some notable improvements to the
design of the EVM:

1. **Wasm**. The Contracts pallet uses WebAssembly as its compilation target. Any language that
   compiles to Wasm can potentially be used to write smart contracts. Nevertheless, it is better to
   have a dedicated domain-specific language, and for that reason Parity offers the [ink!](#ink)
   language.

2. **Deposit**. Contracts must hold a deposit (named _ContractDeposit_ ) suitably large enough in
   order to justify their existence on-chain. A deployer needs to deposit this into the new contract
   on top of the _ExistentialDeposit_.
3. **Caching**. Contracts are cached by default and therefore means they only need to be deployed
   once and afterward be instantiated as many times as you want. This helps to keep the storage load
   on the chain down to the minimum. On top of this, when a contract is no longer being used and the
   _existential deposit_ is drained, the code will be erased from storage (known as reaping).

#### Storage Rent: Deprecated

`pallet_contracts` was initially designed to combat unbounded state growth by charging contracts for
the state they consume but has since been deprecated.

See the associated [pull request](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/9669) for more
details.

### Polkadot Standards Proposals (PSPs)

Web3 Foundation supports proposals for Polkadot that define a set standards to fit ecosystem needs.
These standards go through several acceptance phases, where the engagement of the whole community is
needed to build valuable and future-proof standards. All the teams who will benefit from a standard
need to agree on its content.

Some of these PSPs are targeting Substrate's `contracts` pallet:

- [PSP22 - Fungible Token Standard](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/blob/master/PSPs/psp-22.md) Please
  visit [Polkadot Standards Proposals (PSPs) Github](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs) for more
  information.

### Ink

[ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) is a domain specific language for writing smart contracts
in Rust and compiles to Wasm code. As it states in its README, it is still in an experimental phase
so brave developers should be aware that they might have a bumpy - but workable - development
experience. There are some projects that have built projects in ink! with a decent level of
complexity such as Plasm's [Plasma contracts](https://github.com/staketechnologies/Plasm), so it is
mature enough to start building interesting things.

For interested developers, they can get started writing smart contracts using ink! by studying the
[examples](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples) that were already written. These
can be used as guideposts to writing more complex logic that will be deployable on smart contract
parachains.

ink! has laid much of the groundwork for a new smart contract stack that is based on a Wasm virtual
machine and compatible with Substrate chains.

#### Libraries for Smart Contracts in `ink!`

Collected below are some community examples of smart contracts in `ink!`. **Are you working on a
smart contract example? Ask us to add it to this page!**

- [OpenBrush](https://docs.openbrush.io/): an `ink!` library providing standard contracts based on
  [PSP](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs) with useful contracts and macros for building.
- [ink!athon](https://inkathon.xyz/): Starterkit for full-stack dApps with ink! smart contracts &
  frontend.
- [Metis](https://github.com/patractlabs/metis): a Wasm contract standard library, developed by
  [Patract Labs](https://github.com/patractlabs).

description: Information about building with decentralized storage.
keywords: [build, cloud, storage]
slug: ../build-storage
---

Storage is an integral part of modern computer systems, and the same is true for distributed and
decentralized systems like a blockchain. When interacting with the Polkadot ecosystem, it will be
helpful if you familiarize yourself with the current Web3 approach towards decentralized storage.

## DCS (Decentralized Cloud Storage)

The key attribute that characterizes centralized cloud storage is the location of data.

In decentralized cloud storage, the key attribute becomes the data itself instead of the data's
location.

This can be viewed as the shift from the centralized _location-centric_ storage approach to the
decentralized _content-centric_ approach.

### IPFS (Interplanetary File System)

[IPFS](https://ipfs.tech/) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all
computing devices with the same system of files, by utilizing features such as content-addressing,
content-signing, and enhanced security methods through encryption. IPFS aims to address the current
hurdles of the HTTP-based Internet.

#### Brief comparison of IPFS & HTTP:

### Crust Storage

[Crust Network](https://crust.network) provides a Web3.0 decentralized storage network for the
Metaverse. It is designed to realize core values of decentralization, privacy, and assurance. Crust
supports multiple storage-layer protocols such as [IPFS](#ipfs-interplanetary-file-system), and
exposes instant accessible on-chain storage functions to users. Crust ºs technical stack is also
capable of supporting data manipulating and computing.

Crust provides a native cross-chain communication pallet based on
[XCMP](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-xcm), called
[xStorage](https://github.com/crustio/crust/tree/parachain/shadow/crust-collator/pallets/xstorage).

The protocol also supports most smart contract platforms, including Ethereum, with its
[cross-chain dStorage solution](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildCrossChainSolution).

### Filebase

[Filebase](https://filebase.com) is the first S3-compatible object storage platform that allows you
to store data in a secure, redundant, and performant manner across multiple decentralized storage
networks.

Filebase offers a geo-redundant IPFS pinning service that allows you to pin files to IPFS across
multiple diverse geographic locations. All files uploaded to IPFS through Filebase are automatically
pinned to the Filebase infrastructure with 3x replication across the globe. This ensures that your
data is globally available and redundant at all times.

Filebase acts as an easy on-ramp to IPFS and decentralized storage by offering a user-friendly web
console dashboard, making drag-and-dropping files onto Web3 simple and easy. Filebase also provides
an S3-compatible API for widespread integrations and configurations in current workflows.

#### Using Polkadot-JS Files (IPFS) module

Polkadot-JS UI includes a decentralized storage module that allows Substrate-based chain users to
upload their files to an
[IPFS W3Auth Gateway](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildIPFSWeb3AuthGW) and use the
[IPFS W3Auth Pinning Service](https://wiki.crust.network/docs/en/buildIPFSW3AuthPin) to pin their
files on Crust Network.

Start by uploading a single file or folder:

![upload](../assets/files/substrate-files-1.png)

Choose a Gateway:

![gateway](../assets/files/substrate-files-2.png)

Sign the message:

![sign](../assets/files/substrate-files-3.png)

You should be able to view the file info, as follows:

![file info](../assets/files/substrate-files-4.png)

As well as the file status:

![file statue](../assets/files/substrate-files-5.png)

:::note

The whole files module is decentralized, so your file directory is only cached in browser. The file
directory info will not be visible if you switch to a new browser or clear the browser cache. The
storage module allows you to export file directory info from the current browser and import it to
the new browser.

serialization and deserialization codec.

It is designed for high-performance, copy-free encoding and decoding of data in resource-constrained
execution contexts, such as the Substrate runtime. It is not self-describing in any way and assumes
the decoding context has all type knowledge about the encoded data.

It is used in almost all communication to/from Substrate nodes, so implementations in different
languages exist:

- [Substrate Awesome](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/awesome-substrate#scale-codec)
  maintains a list of SCALE codex implementations.

title: Transaction Construction and Signing
sidebar_label: Transaction Construction
description: Information about how transactions are constructed on Polkadot.
keywords: [transaction, transaction construction, format, tools]
slug: ../build-transaction-construction
---

This page will discuss the transaction format in Polkadot and how to create, sign, and broadcast
transactions. Like the other pages in this guide, this page demonstrates some of the available
tools. **Always refer to each tool's documentation when integrating.**

## Transaction Format

Polkadot has some basic transaction information that is common to all transactions.

- Address: The SS58-encoded address of the sending account.
- Block Hash: The hash of the [checkpoint](build-protocol-info.md#transaction-mortality) block.
- Block Number: The number of the checkpoint block.
- Genesis Hash: The genesis hash of the chain.
- Metadata: The SCALE-encoded metadata for the runtime when submitted.
- Nonce: The nonce for this transaction.\*
- Spec Version: The current spec version for the runtime.
- Transaction Version: The current version for transaction format.
- Tip: Optional, the [tip](build-protocol-info.md#fees) to increase transaction priority.
- Mode: The flag indicating whether to verify the metadata hash or not.
- Era Period: Optional, the number of blocks after the checkpoint for which a transaction is valid.
  If zero, the transaction is [immortal](build-protocol-info.md#transaction-mortality)
- MetadataHash: Optional, the metadata hash which should match the RUNTIME_METADATA_HASH environment
  variable.

:::caution

There are risks to making a transaction immortal. If an account is reaped and a user re-funds the
account, then they could replay an immortal transaction. Always default to using a mortal extrinsic.

:::

\*The nonce queried from the System module does not account for pending transactions. You must track
and increment the nonce manually if you want to submit multiple valid transactions at the same time.

Each transaction will have its own (or no) parameters to add. For example, the `transferKeepAlive`
function from the Balances pallet will take:

- `dest`: Destination address
- `#[compact] value`: Number of tokens (compact encoding)

Refer to [the protocol specifications](https://spec.polkadot.network/id-extrinsics), for the
concrete specifications and types to build a transaction.

**Mode and MetadataHash**

The mode and metadataHash fields were introduced in transaction construction to support the optional
[`CheckMetadataHash` Signed Extension](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/RFCs/blob/main/text/0078-merkleized-metadata.md).
This enables trustless metadata verification by allowing the chain to verify the correctness of the
metadata used without the need of a trusted party. This functionality was included in
[v1.2.5](https://github.com/polkadot-fellows/runtimes/releases/tag/v1.2.5) runtime release by the
Fellowship. A user may up out of this functionality by setting the mode to `0`. When the mode is 00,
the `metadataHash` field is empty/None.

**Serialized transactions and metadata**

Before being submitted, transactions are serialized. Serialized transactions are hex encoded
SCALE-encoded bytes. The relay chain runtimes are upgradable and therefore any interfaces are
subject to change, the metadata allows developers to structure any extrinsics or storage entries
accordingly. The metadata provides you with all of the information required to know how to construct
the serialized call data specific to your transaction. You can read more about the metadata, its
format and how to get it in the
[Substrate documentation](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/command-line-tools/subxt/#metadata).

**Summary**

The typical transaction workflow is as follows:

1. Construct an unsigned transaction.
2. Create a signing payload.
3. Sign the payload.
4. Serialize the signed payload into a transaction.
5. Submit the serialized transaction.

Parity provides the following tools to help perform these steps.

## Polkadot-JS Tools

[Polkadot-JS Tools](https://github.com/polkadot-js/tools) contains a set of command line tools for
interacting with a Substrate client, including one called "Signer CLI" to create, sign, and
broadcast transactions.

This example will use the `signer submit` command, which will create and submit the transaction. The
`signer sendOffline` command has the exact same API, but will not broadcast the transaction.
`submit` and `sendOffline` must be connected to a node to fetch the current metadata and construct a
valid transaction. Their API has the format:

```bash
yarn run:signer <submit|sendOffline> --account <from-account-ss58> --ws <endpoint> <module.method> [param1] [...] [paramX]
```

Signing:

```bash
yarn run:signer sign --account <from-account-ss58> --seed <seed> --type <sr25519|ed25519> <payload>
```

For example, let's send 0.5 DOT from `121X5bEgTZcGQx5NZjwuTjqqKoiG8B2wEAvrUFjuw24ZGZf2` to
`15vrtLsCQFG3qRYUcaEeeEih4JwepocNJHkpsrqojqnZPc2y`.

```bash
yarn run:signer submit --account 121X5bEgTZcGQx5NZjwuTjqqKoiG8B2wEAvrUFjuw24ZGZf2 --ws ws://127.0.0.1:9944 balances.transferKeepAlive 15vrtLsCQFG3qRYUcaEeeEih4JwepocNJHkpsrqojqnZPc2y 5000000000
```

This will return a payload to sign and an input waiting for a signature. Take this payload and use
your normal signing environment (e.g. air gapped machine, VM, etc.). Sign the payload:

```bash
yarn run:signer sign --account 121X5bEgTZcGQx5NZjwuTjqqKoiG8B2wEAvrUFjuw24ZGZf2 --seed "pulp gaze fuel ... mercy inherit equal" --type sr25519 0x040300ff4a83f1...a8239139ff3ff7c3f6
```

Save the output and bring it to the machine that you will broadcast from, enter it into `submit`'s
signature field, and send the transaction (or just return the serialized transaction if using
`sendOffline`).

## Tx Wrapper

If you do not want to use the CLI for signing operations, Parity provides an SDK called
[TxWrapper Core](https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core) to generate and sign transactions
offline. For Polkadot, Kusama, and select parachains, use the `txwrapper-polkadot` package. Other
Substrate-based chains will have their own `txwrapper-{chain}` implementations. See the
[examples](https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core/blob/main/packages/txwrapper-examples/README.md)
for a guide.

**Import a private key**

```ts
import { importPrivateKey } from '@substrate/txwrapper-polkadot';

const keypair = importPrivateKey(‚Äúpulp gaze fuel ... mercy inherit equal‚Äù);
```

**Derive an address from a public key**

```ts
import { deriveAddress } from '@substrate/txwrapper-polkadot';

// Public key, can be either hex string, or Uint8Array
const publicKey = ‚Äú0x2ca17d26ca376087dc30ed52deb74bf0f64aca96fe78b05ec3e720a72adb1235‚Äù;
const address = deriveAddress(publicKey);
```

**Construct a transaction offline**

```ts
import { methods } from "@substrate/txwrapper-polkadot";

const unsigned = methods.balances.transferKeepAlive(
  {
    dest: "15vrtLsCQFG3qRYUcaEeeEih4JwepocNJHkpsrqojqnZPc2y",
    value: 5000000000,
  },
  {
    address: "121X5bEgTZcGQx5NZjwuTjqqKoiG8B2wEAvrUFjuw24ZGZf2",
    blockHash: "0x1fc7493f3c1e9ac758a183839906475f8363aafb1b1d3e910fe16fab4ae1b582",
    blockNumber: 4302222,
    genesisHash: "0xe3777fa922cafbff200cadeaea1a76bd7898ad5b89f7848999058b50e715f636",
    metadataRpc, // must import from client RPC call state_getMetadata
    nonce: 2,
    specVersion: 1019,
    tip: 0,
    eraPeriod: 64, // number of blocks from checkpoint that transaction is valid
    transactionVersion: 1,
  },
  {
    metadataRpc,
    registry, // Type registry
  }
);
```

**Construct a signing payload**

```ts
import { methods, createSigningPayload } from '@substrate/txwrapper-polkadot';

// See "Construct a transaction offline" for "{...}"
const unsigned = methods.balances.transferKeepAlive({...}, {...}, {...});
const signingPayload = createSigningPayload(unsigned, { registry });
```

**Serialize a signed transaction**

```ts
import { createSignedTx } from "@substrate/txwrapper-polkadot";

// Example code, replace `signWithAlice` with actual remote signer.
// An example is given here:
// https://github.com/paritytech/txwrapper-core/blob/b213cabf50f18f0fe710817072a81596e1a53cae/packages/txwrapper-core/src/test-helpers/signWithAlice.ts
const signature = await signWithAlice(signingPayload);
const signedTx = createSignedTx(unsigned, signature, { metadataRpc, registry });
```

**Decode payload types**

You may want to decode payloads to verify their contents prior to submission.

```ts
import { decode } from "@substrate/txwrapper-polkadot";

// Decode an unsigned tx
const txInfo = decode(unsigned, { metadataRpc, registry });

// Decode a signing payload
const txInfo = decode(signingPayload, { metadataRpc, registry });

// Decode a signed tx
const txInfo = decode(signedTx, { metadataRpc, registry });
```

**Check a transaction's hash**

```ts
import { getTxHash } from ‚Äò@substrate/txwrapper-polkadot‚Äô;
const txHash = getTxHash(signedTx);
```

## Submitting a Signed Payload

There are several ways to submit a signed payload:

1. Signer CLI (`yarn run:signer submit --tx <signed-transaction> --ws <endpoint>`)
1. [Substrate API Sidecar](build-node-interaction.md#substrate-api-sidecar)
1. [RPC](build-node-interaction.md#polkadot-rpc) with `author_submitExtrinsic` or
   `author_submitAndWatchExtrinsic`, the latter of which will subscribe you to events to be notified
   as a transaction gets validated and included in the chain.
